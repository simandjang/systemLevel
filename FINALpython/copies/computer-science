By dumping the arVix style tags, you make it easy for everyone to find questions/answers, but also make the site friendlier to less knowledgeable and experienced people such as myself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that's not to say that arVix isn't useful. I believe Stack Exchanges have the &quot;tag wiki&quot; page that Stack Overflow has. It would be benefitial to identify which tags correspond to arVix topic areas and link to those topic areas in the tag wiki for a given tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/115&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://math.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/48/should-mathoverflow-tag-prefixes-be-used&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/186/setting-things-straight-what-style-of-tags-are-we-going-to-be-using-when-we-laun&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/59/mathoverflow-tags-others" />

I have an interest in many computer science topics, but I rarely read computer science publications, have never browsed arVix, and really don't want to learn how to use such a system that I'll never use off of this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I routinely read other publications of papers by the IEEE (in fact, I have the most recent issue of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering next to me right now). Papers in this publication have &quot;index terms&quot; - keywords that describe what the paper is about. I grabbed a copy of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology out of my shelf, and they have three sections: categories and subject descriptions (which contain a code as well as textual descriptions), general terms, and additional key words/phrases. Whenever I've searched for papers in an online database, my matches have always come from the keywords sections or the body of the paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at these tags, they are unwieldy. I have no idea what the tag means, and I wouldn't expect that most undergraduate computer scientists and software engineers would either. Given the responses to [my previous question here on Meta][1], you want to be inclusive of multiple skill levels. If I find it difficult to search and browse through questions based on tags (which are also used in the site search engine), I'll be less likely to use this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of following MathOverflow, I believe that this exchange should follow a path closer to that of [Mathematics][2]. There are [three][3] [relevant][4] [discussions][5] on their Meta that I could find. The Mathematics community appears to be doing quite well in terms of having people of various skill levels (appears to range from undergraduate university-level mathematics on up), their tagging appears to be working quite well, and I honestly find it easier to read and search than MathOverflow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But really, if this Stack Exchange follows MathOverflow, I actually see someone else coming along and making another Computer Science exchange geared toward a broader audience, in terms of skill levels. I think that this exchange can avoid this splintering of the community (avoiding another Unix/Linux versus Ubuntu Stack Exchange problem) by catering to as many people of various skill levels and educational backgrounds as possible. Yes, you need a specific focus on certain topics and clearly define what is and is not on-topic, but you want to segregate based on those topics, not by knowledge or experience. By dumping the arVix style tags, you make it easy for everyone to find questions/answers, but also make the site friendlier to less knowledgeable and experienced people such as myself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that's not to say that arVix isn't useful. I believe Stack Exchanges have the &quot;tag wiki&quot; page that Stack Overflow has. It would be benefitial to identify which tags correspond to arVix topic areas and link to those topic areas in the tag wiki for a given tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, a technical consideration: The [tags are specified using rel=&quot;tag&quot;][8] in the source of a page. If you aren't familiar with microformats, search engines actually do pick up on them and they do help people find pages. People who do searches search for things like &quot;data structure&quot; and &quot;data structures&quot;, not &quot;cs.DS.data-structures&quot;. The tags should reflect what people are searching on Google and Bing so that they are brought to questions on Stack Exchanges that are relevant to their searches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also want to address a few comments and other postings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another point that I've read in [some postings and comments here][6] is that you want to maintain compatibility with MathOverflow. I think this is a mistake. MathOverflow is a Stack Exchange 1.0 site and, last I heard, had no intention of migrating to Stack Exchange 2.0. However, there are a number of Stack Exchange 2.0 sites that might be of interest to this community in some way that are at various levels of existance - Stack Overflow (people might ask algorithm or data structure implementation questions here), Mathematics (which includes discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorics...), Statistical Analysis (which includes machine learning), Not Programming Related, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Application Security, Machine Learning, Numerical Modeling and Simulation, Signal Processing, Operating systems Development, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, and Cryptography (and those are just the first 10 pages of proposals, sorted by progress). These are the communities that need to work together to decide what best belongs where, especially since it appears that there will be a feature to move questions between various Stack Exchange 2.0 sites. Unless things change on MathOverflow, you will never be able to migrate a question from here to MO. However, in the future, it will be possible to migrate questions to the exchanges I mentioned, and so far, none of them are using ArVix tagging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As [first mentioned in a comment here][7], some of the ArVix tags are long. Potentially too long to fit in the limit of a tag. The purpose of tags is to help people search and sort through questions. If you start abbreviating ArVix tags, you open up a whole new can of worms with the best way to abbreviate the tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/115&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://math.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/48/should-mathoverflow-tag-prefixes-be-used&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/186/setting-things-straight-what-style-of-tags-are-we-going-to-be-using-when-we-laun&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/59/mathoverflow-tags-others&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/74#74&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/42#42&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag" />

Even so, however, there might be subtopics within each of these areas that is off-topic, so that would need to be worked out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To address some of the comments:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For filtering purposes. If you just take the top-level tags and mark some of them as &quot;interesting&quot; and some &quot;ignored&quot;, you'll immediately have a very effective filter. If we have the policy that each question is tagged with at least one &quot;top level tag&quot;, your filter should work pretty well. On the other hand, if we just have a large collection of tags that people can use and create however they want, maintaining your filter and keeping it effective (and spotting false positives/negatives) becomes a burden.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think it matters if you have top-level tags for filtering. It's good to have very specific, well-defined tags that mean something specific and where many people know their meaning. Having ambiguous words/phrases/keywords as tags would be a problem, but it doesn't matter what the tag is as long as anyone can look at it and tell what it is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of the use of any tags - I would like to first point out Stack Overflow, Super User, and Server Fault. They allow for random tags, yet the users are able to find and filter based on their preferences. It all boils down to the fact that in a folksonomy, the tags and their meanings will eventually converge. You might be interested in reading [The Complex Dynamics of Collaborative Tagging][1], [Folksonomies: Tidying Up Tags?][2], and Clay Shirky's [Ontology is Overrated][3]. I can recommend a number of other papers on folksonomies and ontologies if you are interested, but the short story is that tagging needs to be more organic and less structured for it to develop meaning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And regarding filters: this site only works if people can use it to get good answers from the experts. We should make the life of those who are looking for relevant questions that they could answer as easy as possible. With &quot;top level tags&quot;, you can just mark your own field of expertise as &quot;interesting&quot; and then check cstheory.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=mytags whenever you have time. Or subscribe to the relevant RSS feed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using plain English terms from a source would accomplish this as well. It doesn't matter if you use the [IEEE Computer Science Keywords][4], [ACM Categories][5], or the [Computing Research Repository subject areas][6]. As long as you have a community practice (either community enforced or by requiring at least one tag from a group of tags), people will be able to find things. It doesn't matter what that tag is. However, I personally feel that &quot;complexity-theory&quot; is much easier to manage than &quot;cc.complexity-theory&quot;. It's more familiar to people who don't use/know ArXiv, but it uses the exact same subject name, allowing people who are interested in the ArXiv knowledge area of complexity theory to follow it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I have a long list of 'uninteresting' tags so as to get rid of topics I don't care about. top level tagging helps me focus positively on stuff I do care about.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is accomplished with any tagging system, given enough time (see the papers and articles I linked to in response to the first comment). It does help to have tags from Day 1 that are meaningful, see my response to the second comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There's a risk that required tags will be confusing for new users. I'm inclined to 'educate' new users, by retagging their questions, but this wouldn't work well if (i) users would be put off by having tags added, or (ii) the retagging would tend not to happen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this is also a good idea, as long as the full ArXiv tags are not used. Like I've said many times, ArXiv tags are too unwieldy. The simplest, and best community-oriented approach (see any number of research reports on developing folksonomies) would be free tagging. However, that doesn't seem to be of interest to the community here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as retagging goes, if the community doesn't edit posts and tags, then the community is failing and this Stack Exchange probably won't survive. If you aren't editing questions and answers to make them better (at least, where it is possible to make them better), and editing tags to make questions easier to find, then you are missing out on the point of how a Stack Exchange is supposed to work. If you aren't editing questions/answers because you don't want other people to edit your postings, then this isn't someplace you want to be since the system is designed to support the editing of posts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1242572.1242602&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january06/guy/01guy.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.computer.org/portal/web/publications/acmtaxonomy&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.jucs.org/jucs_info/acm_categories&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://arxiv.org/corr/subjectclasses" />

I'm a software engineer, but I'm dealing with a lot of topics at work that touch on topics here - algorithms and data structures (especially performance), cryptography, stenography, security, as well as concurrent and distributed systems (but these are more from an applied standing rather than the theoretical that is more appropriate here). Even taking a look back at previous jobs, having a Stack Exchange to ask questions and provide answers about computer science topics I've encountered would have been helpful a long time ago.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If anything is going to be a problem, it's going to be scaring away people who aren't experts in the field. Honestly, I'm not that thrilled with the current state of TCS. It's following MathOverflow too closely and is catering to the experts. What makes Stack Overflow (and even Mathematics and Statistical Analysis) so great is that people of various levels of knowledge and experience are using the exact same site. The problem with MathOverflow (and TCS is going down this road) is that it focuses on the experts and the researchers. TCS does have some college students using it, but many are in a program or that deals exclusively with theoretical CS, and these people appear to be doing OK. However, people like me who have a more practical background, but are interested in the theoretical side of things without a formal education, aren't made to feel as welcome (or at least, that's the impression I get).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think part of the problem is that there is no hands on leadership. This Stack Exchange was proposed by Anand Kulkarni ([meta profile][1], [site profile][2]). Yet this user has less than 200 reputation, has only posted 3 things (1 question, 2 answers) on the main site, and has only posted 2 answers on the meta. So right from Day 1, the person who came up with this idea hasn't been involved in the site. Stack Exchange doesn't give you the tools you need to lay the framework for a site until it goes into Private Beta, and by then, it's too late for the person who came up with this idea to propose a framework of how the system works in his/her mind, since other people have already started to use the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given the focus on experts/experienced people and lack of hands on leadership (although some people are emerging as leaders, so this might turn around with the addition of moderators), I wouldn't be surprised if this Stack Exchange doesn't make it. And I think that it would be a shame if it didn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Are you pleased with the quality and interest of the questions and answers you've seen on the main site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've asked [one question][3], and I'm quite pleased with the answer I got. The way I worded my question, I didn't expect someone to take the time to write up such a detailed answer. But they did, and I'm better off because of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How well do you think we are doing at resolving issues and conflicts that arise?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this is a problem with the Stack Exchange system. The fact that there is no place for meta discussions until the site goes into private beta is a bad thing. So right now, we (and I think several Stack Exchanges have had this problem) have lots of people who read the description of the site, but then got there and were disappointed because the description didn't capture what was really happening. Because of this, everyone comes to Meta after there are already questions and answers posted on the site, time is passing, more questions/answers are being posted, and there's no agreed upon method to do things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it will get better once there are more high reputation users and moderators on the main site, but I do think that this is something that the Stack Exchange team needs to address.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/71/anand-kulkarni&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/71&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/585/what-is-the-difference-between-a-second-preimage-attack-and-a-collision-attack" />

Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that last phrase--CS research with an &quot;**emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor**&quot;--is really the important part, and I would rather err on the side of including too much than too little.  In particular, I think fields like machine learning should be allowed as long as the questions are appropriate.  I don't see overlap with MO as a problem, especially since the emphasis is likely to be different.  " />

The logo text could actually appear as symbols on the TM tape.  One consideration is that space is kind of tight in the logo, so it could be hard to do something too elaborate without it looking cluttered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I find the color scheme on MathOverflow to be hard on my eyes; something a bit more subdued would be nice.

It seems to me that cstheory is the perfect place to ask about whether some concept has an existing crisp formulation.  Previous questions in this vein have included asking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/668/is-there-a-complexity-theory-analogue-of-rices-theorem-in-computability-theory&quot;&gt;something in the spirit of Rice's theorem in complexity theory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/399/analogs-of-compressed-sensing&quot;&gt;my own question on analogs for compressed sensing&lt;/a&gt;.  Information theory is most definitely a part of theoretical computer science, and asking about whether the concept of volume, borrowed from physics, can be suitably formalized or not in an information theoretic sense is undeniably a valid one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moreover, while I'm all for being more strict about soft questions, I feel that being pedantic about the scope of technical questions is going to be a big turn-off to some people.  cstheory is not supposed to be an elite club or something.  It's the virtual equivalent to a coffee break in a conference.  And Fortnow's question would certainly make for interesting conversation there.

I just wish there was a way to give experts a higher starting reputation as I feel some of them get frustrated when they start using the site as they cannot even leave a comment. **A person who has used other SE sites starts with 101, an expert in theoretical computer science who has a long list of papers in FOCS and STOC starts with 1. This does not seem right to me.** I don't know if it is against SE rules or possible at all, but I think it would be nice to manually give these people at least the same reputation that people who have used SE sites beforehand start with. Of course they earn reputation quickly, but the initial frustration can be a bar for active participation of more experts." />

What is an algorithm for that?&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Tag: [ds.algorithms]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(This question is based on a [real question on Food and Cooking Stack Exchange](http://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/5036/how-to-make-pumpkin-fries).  By the way, from my personal experience, I strongly discourage you to visit _that_ website when you are hungry.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is outright off-topic on our website, right?  After all, it is a question about cooking, not in the theoretical computer science.  But this question is clearly asking for an algorithm.  Although its goal is not to compute any mathematical objects and it is usually called a recipe, these do not mean that it is not an algorithm.  “It cannot be implemented on computers or Turing machines” does not sound like a good reason that it is not an algorithm, either.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;“Well,” you might say, “even if the question is about algorithms, it is too vague for a question in the theoretical computer science.  How do you define ‘pumpkin fries,’ ‘crispy’ and ‘soft’?  Oh, and you speak of the outside and inside.  Do you mean that pumpkin fries lie in a topological space?”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if we think this way, it starts to sound as if we should close it as “not a real question” or “subjective and argumentative,” not as off topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am still pretty sure that the question _is_ off topic, but I find it more difficult than I thought to define when a question is about algorithms, especially because I believe that it is correct to say that a cooking recipe is an algorithm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Question**.  What are the criteria to call some question “a question about algorithms,” and are questions asking for cooking recipes “about algorithms” according to your criteria?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What made me think about this is [the recent question asking how to verify someone’s claim that analog sound is better than digital sound](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1697/does-analog-sound-have-something-that-digital-does-not-closed).  I removed the [ds.algorithms] tag from it and voted to close it as off topic, and it soon got closed.  But I have just realized that the question _was_ asking for an algorithm.  Now I wonder how to justify the claim that this question is off topic.&#xD;&#xA;" />

If the pioneering people had failed, we could have ended up with an [empty restaurant](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/area-51-asking-the-first-questions/) — no one is there, therefore nothing interesting is there, therefore no one wants to visit there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thanks to the first participants (especially [those who participated while the site was in private beta](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/badges/16/beta)), the website as a whole seems to have survived the risk of the empty restaurant syndrome.  However, that does not mean that the risk has gone in each subfield of the theoretical computer science.  I see many strong questions in complexity theory and algorithms, so I guess that the website has survived the risk of the empty restaurant syndrome in these areas.

It seems that if a question is too elementary, it is often closed for the reason “off topic.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I understand that this choice of reason is based on the consensus about the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  However, if a question is closed for the reason “off topic,” the following explanation is added to the question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; closed as off topic by [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone] [Date]&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Questions on Theoretical Computer Science are expected to generally relate to Theoretical Computer Science, within the scope defined in the [faq](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have trouble even parsing this sentence because of the tentative name of the website, but more importantly this does not mention the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  It plainly states that the question is not related to the theoretical computer science, which is often false.  This gives the false impression that we take the theoretical computer science very narrowly.  I think that this is problematic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(_Added in revision 5_: The link in the explanation quoted above links to the [built-in FAQ](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq), not to the [FAQ on Meta](http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science).  The built-in FAQ is not clear about the expected level of questions, either, except that the sentence “Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields” may suggest that research-level questions are expected.  A clearer statement can be reached by the following chain of links: the explanation of “off topic” → [built-in FAQ](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq) → [FAQ on Meta](http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science) → [What kind of questions are too basic?](http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235)  But I doubt that users can find this path unless they are already familiar with the website.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What should we do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few suggestions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. If the consensus is really that cstheory.stackexchange.com is for questions of at least certain level, the explanation of the reason “off topic” should be rewritten to reflect it.  Is this possible?&#xD;&#xA;2. On [MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/), too elementary questions are often closed for the reason “too localized.”  Obviously this is an abuse and [it certainly confuses some users](http://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/274/what-does-too-localized-mean-exactly/), but it is possible to interpret it as “This question is so elementary that it is useful only for the asker,” and it is understandable (or at least less prone to misunderstanding).  How about adopting this convention, at least until the explanation of “off topic” is modified to a better description?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- See a [related FAQ entry](http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235) and the links given there for discussions about what we mean by “too elementary.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_Added in revision 4:_ Whereas the description of the close reason is not shown on the question page on MathOverflow, it is shown on cstheory.stackexchange.com, which may make abusing harder.  Here is the description of the close reason “too localized”:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This question would only be relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The point of the suggestion 2 above is that it is at least possible to argue that too elementary questions fall into the third group (and possibly also the second group) of this description.&#xD;&#xA;" />

On the other hand, if 20% of the questions on the top page are like this and few of them get answers interesting to me (and worse yet, they are bumped by [community ♦](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/-1/community) from time to time), I am sure that I will get sick of those questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_Added_: Another example of the how-to-model-this questions is “[Finding islands of vertices in a network of roads containing one-way streets](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2227/finding-islands-of-vertices-in-a-network-of-roads-containing-one-way-streets-clo)” by shindigo.  This question was closed, and I was one of those who voted to close it.  Honestly speaking, I did not realize that this question was in the same “how-to-model-this” category until Suresh pointed out in a comment to the question (silly me).  I hope that comparing these two questions (and possibly other questions in the same category) may shed some light on _what we want to aim at_ about how-to-model-this questions.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Often new graduate students do not know which area they want to work in as they are not familiar with various areas.

Many answers cite references and can lead to interesting problems to work on. Students can also post questions they face while reading papers. Answers from experts are more than just answers, they contain insights that are not available in papers or textbooks (e.g. [Russell's answer](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2434/why-do-complexity-classes-translate-upwards-and-not-downwards/2453#2453)).

These mechanisms also work to reduce the amount of spam&#xD;&#xA;and other undesirable content on the site, and  to keep the &#xD;&#xA;questions asked on topic.  These mechanisms include up- or down-voting &#xD;&#xA;questions and answers, flagging spam and other inappropriate content, and receiving _badges_ as rewards for good questions and answers or sustained activity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both questions and answers on the site are voted up or down by users and sorted by their score.

For example, a student who requested a &quot;commonsense explanation&quot; for how padding arguments related to complexity class separations received [an intuitive answer from Russell Impagliazzo](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2434/why-do-complexity-classes-translate-upwards-and-not-downwards/2453#2453); and a student who asked whether the Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom number generator relativizes received [an answer from Noam Nisan](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2236/does-nisans-pseudo-random-generator-relativize/2239#2239).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to specific technical questions by both students and top experts, people have asked for more general advice from the community, on everything from [Master's Thesis topics](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/979/automata-theory-formal-language-thesis-topic) to &quot;[how to find a job](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2215/how-to-get-a-job).&quot;  The overall scope of the site is **Research-level theoretical computer science, broadly defined**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Everyone with a research interest in theoretical computer science is welcome to create an account and post questions and answers.

The StackExchange software provides mechanisms, such as up- or down-voting &#xD;&#xA;questions and answers, to highlight and encourage excellent questions and answers, and to control spam.  There is also a &quot;Meta&quot; area, for discussions about site scope and direction.  As one example, this announcement you are reading right now was written by a group of users on cstheory-Meta.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many of the founding members of [cstheory.stackexchange.com](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/) had participated in discussion of a proposed solution of the P/NP problem that spanned multiple blogs, led to creation of wiki pages, and brought together researchers in disparate areas from around the world.  It became clear that the theoretical computer science community was ready for -- and needed -- a structured way to crowdsource questions to an international audience of experts.  We felt that emulating the site format (and the question-and-answer policy) of the successful MathOverflow was the logical thing to try, and we're very pleased by the results so far.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please visit -- and participate in! -- [cstheory.stackexchange.com](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/), the 24/7/365 gathering-place for theoretical computer scientists from around the world to share information and insights.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/522/beta-period-progress/526#526&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/522/beta-period-progress" />

These questions will be asked by someone with only the best intentions at heart, and will be immediately &quot;voted to be closed&quot; and commented upon by moderators, typically in a fashion that might be characterized as abrasive, if not rude.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I recognize the importance of keeping the site clean of obvious spam and questions that truly detract from the experience of using the site or the general quality of the content...but do we really need to be so harsh on people who post at least semi-reasonable questions?  Rather than immediately write a comment to the effect of, &quot;This is the worst question I've ever seen, I think it should be closed immediately,&quot; why not work with posters of sub-optimal questions to try to help them improve the quality?  You could give people twelve hours of grace (or something) before the topic is closed.  This way, I think you might do a better job at avoiding driving newbies away.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not asking this question in the spirit of being accusatory; I just want to make a gentle suggestion that someone rethink the topic closure policy.  I think that given that one of the goals of the site is outreach to non-experts in the field (and I'm certainly one of these non-experts!), I think it would make a lot of sense to think seriously about doing a quick cost-benefit analysis of being so strict on topic closure.  What do you gain, and what might you lose by being so strict/abrasive?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In order that this question might not get closed as &quot;not a real question&quot; :), let me ask one:  What is the *justification* for the strictness on question closure?  I am not sure that there isn't one, so perhaps I should ask if there isn't some deep-seated StackOverflow cultural mandate that I wasn't aware of that would make my comments above appear foolish.  If there's a perfectly good reason for handling topic closure the way it's being handled now, I'd love to know what it is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thanks for any thoughts on or answers to this.&#xD;&#xA;" />

I really appreciate the design. I wanted to make one aesthetic suggestion, though: I think the title &quot;THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE&quot; can be made more appealing by using the Title-Case instead of UPPER-CASE: &quot;Theoretical Computer Science&quot;. A Turing tape does not necessarily hold upper-case symbols, right?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One more suggestion: In computer science, there's a notion of **oracles**. Informally, they are functions that &quot;know&quot; the answer to some specified question, and can compute and return it in **one step**. I think this concept can be used in the design; specifically when an expert (the oracle) answers a question. Specifically, I like the idea with up-voting/down-voting a question/answer. One can imagine the oracle concept replacing the &quot;pen tips&quot; in the TeX design:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/pcBty.png&quot; /&gt;" />

It's a terrific, robust, and growing community that is clearly making an increasing contribution to the state of CS Theory research.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Something we keep thinking about, though, in the context of the entire Stack Exchange network, is how broad a Stack Exchange site should be. I blogged about this a little bit [here](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/merging-season/):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; So: the right size might be somewhere around the size of a university department. Somehow, the cultural anthropologists don’t mind sharing a building with the physical anthropologists, and when they both find themselves at the Yale-Harvard football game, you can bet that they’ll sit together and find something anthropological to talk about. Similarly, at Stack Overflow, the Java Entity Bean programmers at insurance companies don’t mind all the iPhone developers asking Objective C questions about the horrible, horrible game they’re working on. Heck, they might become iPhone developers one day. And they both share the humiliation of not being able to fix their uncle’s virus-infested Windows XP machine when they’re home for Thanksgiving.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So that leads to the obvious question... is *this* site too narrow? I don't know of many universities that have a Theoretical Computer Science department; they all have Computer Science departments and the algorithms purists don't seem to mind having Friday tea with the computer vision geeks. And the idea of meeting somebody who is working on AI is, it turns out, not *entirely* too horrible to contemplate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm concerned that there are non-theoretical aspects of Computer Science research that don't have a home right now. If you look around Area51 you'll see proposals for crpytography, operating systems, compilers, cognitive science, numerical modeling, computer vision, bioinformatics, history of computers, and a lot of other fields that aren't quite reaching critical mass. We had an AI site that failed to ignite due to a lack of actual AI researchers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not saying all of those are on topic, but if a university had, say, two professors interested in cognitive science, I'm pretty sure they'd just stick them into the CS department and nobody would think that was strange or upsetting or crashing the party.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Right now, though, I see researchers all over the computer science department that don't really have a place to participate, and the idea of making dozens of thin little sites to cover every possible ACM SIG strikes me as ignoring one of the great reasons that Stack Overflow succeeded in the first place: because we brought together *all* programmers to talk about code, and we created a reliable and robust tagging system so that you could quickly find the topics and people that you cared about, and because nobody minded (and many people enjoyed) the occasional brushing-of-shoulders with people who shared the same values but worked in different technologies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Can we do something here? I think that sticking to *research-level* conversation is a great common denominator, but there are an awful lot of interesting topics that are excluded right now which could really use a home. See, for example, [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/)'s idea about what constitutes &quot;computer science&quot;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Artificial Intelligence; Computation and Language; Computational Complexity; Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science; Computational Geometry; Computer Science and Game Theory; Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Computers and Society; Cryptography and Security; Data Structures and Algorithms; Databases; Digital Libraries; Discrete Mathematics; Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing; Emerging Technologies; Formal Languages and Automata Theory; General Literature; Graphics; Hardware Architecture; Human-Computer Interaction; Information Retrieval; Information Theory; Learning; Logic in Computer Science; Mathematical Software; Multiagent Systems; Multimedia; Networking and Internet Architecture; Neural and Evolutionary Computing; Numerical Analysis; Operating Systems; Other Computer Science; Performance; Programming Languages; Robotics; Social and Information Networks; Software Engineering; Sound; Symbolic Computation; Systems and Control&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of that stuff is already on topic here, but a lot of it is sadly homeless in the Stack Exchange network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My belief is that broadening this site to &quot;computer science&quot; and allowing discussion on any *research-level* topic that fits in one of the arXiv categories of Computer Science (and possibly even using those categories as tags) would make this site grow quickly into a much larger and stronger resource that attracts people in computer science departments around the world, rather than a thinner site that attempts to stitch together just the purely theoretical disciplines. Of course through the use of tags and our tag following feature, every participant could define their own filtered view of what kinds of topics they are interested in following, but if you want to reach outside of your narrow research interest once in a while there will be lots of other interesting stuff going on here too. And the opportunity to connect, even accidentally, with researchers who are ostensibly working outside of purely theoretical computer science but might, nonetheless, face the same types of problems seems like too good an opportunity to pass up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What do you think?" />

I trust that Computer Science would also allow for applied research, not exclusively theoretical research (however that strikes folks as different).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We still have the confusion of computer science and programming to deal with, but I think that is not something we can control and it is no reason *not* to broaden this StackExchange theme to Computer Science researchiness (however one draws the line about that)." />

This means that I do not know how its scope was determined to be “theoretical computer science” instead of something broader like “computer science” or something narrower like “algorithms and data structure.”  And I do not value much the opinion of a person who does not know the history.  You should consider whether my opinion should count at all._&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I like the idea of broadening the scope.  Theoretical computer science has much to offer to and hear from applied fields.  However, broadening the scope is dangerous to the quality of answers, especially to topics with fewer users.  Therefore, I support broadening the topic only if we have a plan to keep the quality of answers in minor topics high.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stack Overflow fits the model with a broad scope with many subtopics, and therefore I think that it is useful to see what happens there:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. I guess that Stack Overflow has many C# users who are not usually interested in PHP and many PHP users who are not usually interested in C#, and I guess that they coexist just by using different tags.  If this is true, we may use the same method.  Occasionally we can see questions in the other tags to see if anything interesting is going on in the next room.&#xD;&#xA;2. However, less popular topics are miserable on Stack Overflow.  I have seen several high-score answers to questions about Haskell which are incorrect apparently because the answerer lacks real-world experience with the language.  I imagine that not many Haskell experts are interested in Stack Overflow because the top page almost certainly contains no questions about functional programming.  If there were a Stack Exchange website dedicated to programming in functional programming languages, the situation might have been different.  I do not want to see the same thing happen on the proposed SE site with the broader topic.&#xD;&#xA;" />

I am intrigued by the passion poured into it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would like to get your thoughts from a different angle &amp;mdash; Rather than contemplating whether you would allow this *expansion* of topics, I would like to see what you think about being *included* in an inevitable site covering the larger field of &quot;Computer Science.&quot; There's a big demand for these topics and they inevitably *have* to go&amp;hellip; somewhere.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What we are really proposing here is the creation of something like a *virtual* Grand University of Computer Science. I've been looking at the [ACM SIGs](http://www.acm.org/sigs) while Joel cites the [Cornell arXiv: Computer Science ](http://arxiv.org/) library. Either way, I very much envision this hypothetical site being a higher-level academic setting where you have that sense of place of belonging to a top-branded university; a place where a community of students, professionals, and scholars collaborate about higher education topics and research.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The simple question we are coming to you with&amp;hellip;** Can we break ground here and expand your college into a top-tier, well-equipped, full-fledged University? Or, do we have to go a few miles down the road and find another piece of property and build our campus there?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You've already created your own specialized, great virtual college campus here. You've certainly earned your respected place to keep as you see fit, no doubt. But the (currently) top-voted answer laments that &quot;Theory is marginalized enough in CS as it is.&quot; In that vein, I am having trouble envisioning a site purported to be a virtual CS University, but always having that &lt;sup&gt;little&lt;/sup&gt; asterisk that says: &lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;but for Theoretical questions, go here &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;rarr;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My question may be a bit loaded, but I would like to point out that there is a lot of value in having a strong site that includes *your* topics of interest. Topics don't simply disappear because people are also talking about related topics. The community doesn't let it. If the tag-set is strong, the subject stays strong. These sites scale wonderfully. The traditional religious and platform wars simply do not happen; all are welcomed and we all get along&amp;hellip; somehow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We've already proven that the network effects of scale far, far outweigh the niche closeness you might feel here." />

It is not just computer science proposals, I don't know *any* other scientific research level proposal that has got launched. We can discuss these things but I am strongly against making a decision too quickly. We should always have in mind what *we* were trying to achieve when we started this site and the effects any changes to the model will have on it. We want and need researchers on the site and anything which will have a negative effect on our ability to attract and maintain researchers is a bad thing. My personal opinion is that one of the reasons that cstheory got where it is right now is following a model on a related topic which has worked, i.e. MathOverflow, and we still haven't reached the place in Theory community that MathOverflow has in Math community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also don't see what this is going to solve. Each area needs to attract researchers, putting all of those who are already there won't solve any problem. SE needs researchers in AI to answer AI questions and as long as they are not here nothing will change. I think all of the expected benefits of a unified site can be achieved by having multiple sites, one for each area and then having a unified *view* like the way [stackexchange.com][1] is unifying questions from many sites in one place (and nothing more like sharing reputation or votes).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am also concerned about some of specific points of the proposal and the issues they can create, e.g. based on Physics.SE's experience, I am clearly against sharing reputation, especially if it is going to be shared with a non-research level questions/answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, I don't think we have reached a state that we can relax and start to think about ways to modify the site, the site is just a few months old, many active research areas in theory are still heavily under-represented on cstheory, we should first get more researchers on those topics on cstheory before starting to worry about AI or Graphics or Systems. That is what we should focus on. The possible benefits of any modifications to cstheory are unclear in the best case and the possible negative consequences are considerable. I think we should wait for a year to let the site stabilize, changing things just a few months after cstheory's launch is not a good thing, we want to establish a brand in theory community, we have written a SIGACT article advertising the site just a few months ago to attract researchers in theory, any dramatic change will send the wrong signal to the community. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Think of cstheory as your company, would you make radical changes to its structure just after your first successful product is starting to get attention from consumers where the possible benefits of the changes are small/unclear and the risks are considerable?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://stackexchange.com/" />

Users are expected to do their part and try to answer their question by themselves before posting them on cstheory and asking for help from others.

The quality of posts so far has been excellent, from a diverse group of people, and as I write this, there are at least three posts in the pipeline to be written by contributors (i.e., not by the blog editors), so in that sense participation is good.  Where we are falling down is that we are not being read by people outside of CSTheory itself, and the number of hits per day from internet searches is very low.  I believe the second one is due to low blog pagerank, because my personal blog, which is updated far less often, gets much more traffic from searches (not counting searches for topical things like the hacker group Anonymous, which I have mentioned on my blog, but is not mentioned in the community blog).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I see the following steps we can take.  Some Joe and I can just do, but others we need help on.  Also, I'd very much like to hear the ideas of others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Resolve once and for all our participation in the TOC Blog Aggregator.**  Once again, our post is not appearing there.  I have no idea what the deal is, but this one step would double our traffic.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*  **Produce a couple static pages with useful community content.**  I have some time this weekend, and I will put together the page on theoretical computer science conferences, now that the community wiki question I asked to gather that information has stabilized.  *Perhaps someone else could volunteer to produce a page on links to career advice, and other such resources?*  (If no one does, I will eventually get to it, but it might take a whiiiiile.)  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*  **Fully flesh out the blogroll and links of the blog.**  This includes having updates of other blogs when they put up a new post (so not just the names of the blogs, but one line snapshots into their content).  Point being: there is a reason for a reader to stop by, even if we have not put up a new post in a few days.  This also has the perhaps-more-important effect of making the blog appear more professional.  (An Admin might have to do this step, not sure whether Joe and I can.)  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*  **Change the design so it looks professional and not tacky as hell.**  Part of the reason that I am disappointed we're not being picked up by the TOC Aggregator is that I much prefer reading posts on the Aggregator.  The current sketchy non-design of our blog is not friendly to my eyes.  Do we need to deal with SE on this?  It would take 30 minutes max to download a WordPress theme, and that alone would raise our return traffic a nontrivial amount.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Okay, thanks.  That's all I have for now.

Too much personal tone can be distracting, and reducing the personal tone can improve the readability of a question (or perhaps also an answer).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this particular example, the question before the edit sounds a little like a diary rather than a question written as a question from the beginning.  It is fine in a blog, but it is probably suboptimal on a Q&amp;A website.  I guess that this is why Kaveh felt the need for an edit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, in this particular example, I do not think that it was done well.  I do not like the opening after the edit:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There is always a way for application in topics related to theoretical computer science.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Despite the intent of the edit which Kaveh explained, this does not sound like a professional to me.  Instead, it sounds like some newbie who tries to pretend to be a professional.  Frankly speaking, the question sounded at least honest before the edit, but it sounds pretentious after the edit.  I am sorry, but I do not like how the question is stated after the edit at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, it should be pointed out that [we encourage to include a personal motivation in a question](http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/300/how-to-ask-a-good-question/306#306): we want a question which the asker cares out of his/her own interest rather than a question which the asker thinks that someone cares.  In this sense, good questions necessarily contain some personal part.  I do not think that it is right to remove everything personal from a question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thinking this way, it seems very difficult to edit a question to reduce the personal tone while maintaining some degree of personality.  If you do it, you should do it right.  I guess that it is a perfectly reasonable choice to give up such a difficult task and just either leave the question open or close it.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Winners of each round will also get 100 USD to donate to charity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here’s how the battle will work:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Participating sites are English, Math, Statistics, Theoretical Computer Science, Linguistics, Physics, Philosophy, and History.&#xD;&#xA; - Each round will last a week, and the contest will be single-elimination bracket-style. &#xD;&#xA; - To move on to the next round, the average number of questions each site asks per day during the round must exceed that site’s current average. Whichever site exceeds their average by more questions wins the round. &#xD;&#xA; - To determine who would face off in the first round, we seeded the sites according to past activity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Are you ready for this?! Here it is:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A few more notes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Although this is a contest, a “Battle of the Sites” if you will, it’s all in the spirit of fundraising for charity and having fun.

It is not easy to see whether a question is research-level or not unless the author of the question explains the motivation and background.

If you think there is nice question hidden inside a question, then you can make suggestions to the OP to improve the question, or ask a new question yourself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. The opinion at the time was that we are not closing the question too quickly, there is no problem with closing clearly off-topic questions as soon as possible. If later the question is improved to an on-topic question it can be reopened. As you could see from the state of this discussion before your new answer, it was accepted that quickly closing these questions is fine so I am not sure why you expected a change regrading in closing them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ps: next time, please start a new discussion by posting a question in place of posting an answer to an old discussion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/361#361" />

It does not include questions at the level of difficulty of typical undergraduate course/textbook homework/exercise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For an explanation of what TCS is, we refer you to the description of ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra.  **Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##My question is not a research-level question in TCS, where can I ask it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For questions other than research-level questions in TCS, you may want to consider the following places to ask:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * General Computer Science — [Computer Science - Stack Exchange](http://cs.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * General Mathematics (including *theoretical* CS) — [Mathematics - Stack Exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Research-level Mathematics — [Math Overflow](http://mathoverflow.net/)&#xD;&#xA; * Programming — [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * General Artificial Intelligence — [Meta Optimize](http://metaoptimize.com/qa/)&#xD;&#xA; * Statistics and Data Mining — [Cross Validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Applied Cryptography and Security — [Crypto - Stack Exchange](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Computation used in Science and Engineering — [Computational Science - Stack Exchange](http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Questions about this site — [Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange - Meta][1]&#xD;&#xA; * Other — check the list of sites on [Stack Exchange Network](http://stackexchange.com/sites)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Questions should be based on knowledge sharing, not on shirking&#xD;&#xA;You should only post questions you're actually seriously thinking about. Users are expected to do their part and try to answer their question by themselves before posting them on cstheory and asking for help from others. Search to see if your question is already answered somewhere else (e.g. Wikipedia) before asking a question. **Try to make your question interesting for others by providing some background knowledge**. Remember, *questions should be based on knowledge sharing, not on shirking. Shirking goes against the spirit of the site.* &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Tips about writing better questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [How to Ask?](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-ask)&#xD;&#xA;* [How to ask a good question?](http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/300/how-to-ask-a-good-question)&#xD;&#xA;* [How to write a good MathOverflow question?](http://mathoverflow.net/howtoask)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please also check our list of [**useful resources**](http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/229#229) *before* asking a question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##FAQ&#xD;&#xA;Currently we have two separate lists of FAQs.

We welcome _research-level_ questions in _theoretical computer science_ (TCS).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although there is no black-and-white distinction between research-level questions and non-research-level questions, questions are considered to be &quot;research-level&quot; roughly when they can be discussed between two professors or between two graduate students working on Ph.D.'s, but not usually between a professor and a typical undergraduate student. It does not include questions at the level of difficulty of typical undergraduate course/textbook homework/exercise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For an explanation of what TCS is, we refer you to the description of ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra.  **Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##My question is not a research-level question in TCS, where can I ask it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For questions other than research-level questions in TCS, you may want to consider the following places to ask:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * General Computer Science — [Computer Science - Stack Exchange](http://cs.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * General Mathematics (including *theoretical* CS) — [Mathematics - Stack Exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Research-level Mathematics — [Math Overflow](http://mathoverflow.net/)&#xD;&#xA; * Social and Professional Academic Issues — [Academia - Stack Exchange](http://academia.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Programming — [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * General Artificial Intelligence — [Meta Optimize](http://metaoptimize.com/qa/)&#xD;&#xA; * Statistics and Data Mining — [Cross Validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Applied Cryptography and Security — [Crypto - Stack Exchange](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Computation used in Science and Engineering — [Computational Science - Stack Exchange](http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Questions about this site — [Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange - Meta][1]&#xD;&#xA; * Other — check the list of sites on [Stack Exchange Network](http://stackexchange.com/sites)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Questions should be based on knowledge sharing, not on shirking&#xD;&#xA;You should only post questions you're actually seriously thinking about.

While I try to judge this proposal on its own merit, it is likely that the time and energy I have invested in CS.SE influences me.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm afraid that broadening the scope in this way would destroy the existing community. A Stack Exchange site is defined by two things: the kind of questions it accepts, and the audience it attracts. Even though each question is in principle judged on its intrinsic merits, the long-term effect is to create a community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On this site, the community is centered around researchers in theoretical computer science. Participants tend to be researchers in TCS, researchers in other fields, or graduate students aspiring to become researchers. The participants who are welcomed are generally those who came with the expectation of participating in a community dominated by TCS researchers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do not see a problem with allowing more applied questions. As long as academics and people who want to fit in with academics dominate the site, that isn't a problem. It may be difficult to bootstrap an applied CS community (it would have been a lot easier to do when the site was young), but if it works, it won't change the tone of the site, and if it fails, the site won't have changed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, opening the door to more basic questions means opening the door to a broader audience. This should be a carefully controlled process. In particular, I advise you not to try to draw on Stack Overflow as an audience base. A majority of Stack Overflow does not know or care what it means to be a scientist. The kind of people you would attract are those who now post on [Programmers](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/). If you attract those people, be prepared to moderate their content. And to moderate them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Reacting to specific points in your proposal:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We now have a natural forum (cs.stackexchange.com) for the more &quot;basic&quot; algorithms questions, and the cstheory &quot;brand&quot; is well established as a 'research-only' venue. So we have an easy process to shunt questions that are obviously undergrad level.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind that CS.SE is not exclusively for basic questions. It is for questions at all level, ranging all the way from CS 101 homework to applied research (and even research in theory, but we suggest CSTheory.SE to the rare asker who comes with a theory question that seems to go unanswered because it is too hard).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; excluding questions from people who might be 'research-level' in a sub area but aren't experts in some other domain&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From what I see (I admit to not following CSTheory.SE very closely), this already happens: as long as there's a feeling that peers are talking with peers, questions tend to be appreciated, left open and answered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; creating the impression of an unfriendly site (which is a bigger problem in terms of maintaining the audience)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the community is doing an adequate job of retaining the audience it likes in and keeping the undesirables in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All in all, while the current guidelines may be stricter than this, I think an intelligent application of the existing policies already gives you what you want.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Scott Aaronson in his blog sometimes uses the scenario of super-intelligent alien beings having a discussion with us to emphasise the universality of certain notions in mathematics or computer science. This post felt like a very scaled-down but realistic form of that thought experiment. A person from a different, but closely related field comes to us and says, &quot;we do logic, you do logic, and we have all these cool results, but what do you have to show for your logic.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; It is difficult to tell from the wording how deep the author's knowledge of classical mathematical logic is, but the question does request for answers that appeal to advanced logical concepts. I was absolutely gung-ho about writing an answer because questions that specifically want and advanced-level survey are rare. A couple of hours later, I realised that this was never going to end. I'm glad to see that the question has now been made community wiki. I think my current answer is too long and should be split into different answers. I have three concrete proposals for answers to that question. Please let me know if you agree with these proposals.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Proposal 1*. Every answer discusses a specific sub-area of computational logic and consists of three paragraphs. The first paragraph give a high-level overview of the field aimed at researchers in mathematics or TCS. The second paragraph highlights some results in the field and techniques used to prove those results. The third paragraph mentions current directions and open problems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Proposal 2*. We make a &quot;table of contents&quot; answer that lists different sub-areas of computational logic and hyperlinks to the different answers. Anyone can add to this list, and then add a separate answer for the area mentioned.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Proposal 3.* If the OP agrees, we modify the original question a bit to make explicit the structure desired for answers. (We could also do this in the ToC answer I suggest in Proposal 2, but people might not read other answers before replying.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I feel such an advanced research summary would be a valuable resource for the future reference, and that obtaining such a survey via our user base would be effective. If it works here, we could also follow a similar protocol/structure for certain other broad reference requests. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What say ye?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/15061/pointers-for-cs-applications-of-logic" />

But I think people have been too quick to label some questions as &quot;too elementary&quot;, when in fact they describe very real research-level questions.  For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [How are lower bounds for computational complexity proved?](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18372/111)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [Roots of a polynomial](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18406/111)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In both cases, there is an undergraduate-level &quot;textbook&quot; answer.

But if we look past those easy answers, these are legitimate research-level questions in theoretical computer science.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Okay, but then how does one prove lower bounds for problems that can't be solved by comparison trees?  Or lower bounds bigger than $\Omega(n\log n)$ for problems solvable in polynomial time?  Or exponential lower bounds for NP-hard problems?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Okay, but then how does one actually find integer roots of polynomials in practice?  Are there effective algorithms for broad and interesting classes of polynomials?  Are there algorithms with provable approximation guarantees (for interesting classes of polynomials)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In both cases, the deeper question is likely not what the original poster intended.  (But StackExchange answers are for the entire community, not just for the original poster.  And why should we shy away from blowing the original poster's mind?)

We have discussed previously that we are not going to require or even demand people to explain their votes. When I see a down-vote that I don't understand I politely comment that I don't understand it, but I think demanding an explanation or stating that there is no reason for the down-vote goes too far. It is not an abuse if people are using their votes in a way different from us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have argued a number of times that I am against counter-voting, that is voting to null the effect of other users' vote. Everyone has their own opinion. It is not the job of any particular user to decide what the total should be, the total reflects the opinion of the community. Counter-voting encourages other users to do the same and use their votes to null votes in place of express their opinion about the question. The votes are manifestation of other people's opinions and if we respect other people's opinion then we should respect their votes even when we disagree with them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this particular case, I see several possible reasons for a down-vote. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Formating: It is using an image in place of writing it which I think has been one of the reasons people down-vote. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Content: The questions seems to simply ask how to calculate some expression for some particular values. It seems to ask how to apply a method explained in a paper in particular case in practice. It is too localized and it doesn't seem to be a _research-level_ question in _theoretical_ computer science.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it is more productive if we comment and explain why we think it is a suitable and interesting question in place of just asking others why they have down-voted the post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ask me I think we are being too open right now (I guess it is partly because people get bored that there are not as many questions as they would like) to questions which should not be here and are more suitable for CS.SE. E.g. [1](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/18703/are-randomized-algorithms-considered-as-complete), [2](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/18628/confused-about-disparity-and-depth-map), [3](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/18886/proof-that-turing-machine-and-lambda-calculus-are-equivalent), [4](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/18575/pigeon-holing-or-bucketing-a-number-based-on-a-set-of-ranges) have been in closing review queue for sometime but has not been put _on-hold_.

Questions in CSTheory are typically at the &quot;grad student or higher level&quot;. As a quick rule of thumb, if the answer can be found in a textbook or by relatively straightforward googling, then CSTheory is NOT the place for it.

So if a question was asked on CS.SE but would also be suitable for Theoretical Computer Science, usually someone suggests migrating it there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assuming that the question is indeed about theoretical computer science, that it has gone unanswered for long enough that we doubt it will be answered on CS.SE, and that the asker is willing, **should we migrate the question to CSTheory.SE?** Should we ask first, and where? ([Chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/9446/theory-salon)? but it's pretty much dead.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Only [moderators of CS.SE](http://cs.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderators) can initiate the migration; if we do it it would typically be in response to a flag, often a flag from the asker.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that if you feel that a question should not have been migrated to CSTheory, you can close it; this will bounce the question back to its original site, but not reopen it there. (This is known as rejecting the migration.) If you find a question migrated from CS.SE and you think that it is not suitable for CSTheory.SE but should have remained open on CS.SE, please vote to close it here, and once it is closed here please flag it for reopening on CS.SE.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Do you think that referring specifically to the user who asks the question and his or her perceived capabilities (e.g., &quot;lack of mathematical maturity&quot;, as expressed by some moderators) is a legitimate reason (or part of a reason) for closing a question? Or should you judge a question only by its own merits?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mostly by its own merits.  If you know that the person asking the question is, for example, a famous researcher, then it makes sense to re-evaluate the question with this in mind.  But a bad question is a bad question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *In your opinion, what do moderators do?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators basically should try to keep the site running smoothly with as little intervention as possible.  This involves deleting content that doesn't belong, stopping arguments that get out of hand, guiding new users, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's fine with me.  (Though if I were running the stackexchange site, I might have chosen a different design decision.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The software makes moderator votes immediately binding, so this lets them resolve egregious issues more quickly.  Of course moderators also have access even 20k users do not.  However, more importantly, because moderators are elected by the community, they can speak for the community in a way high rep users cannot.  This also means that moderators should be more careful in what they say and how they use their privileges.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *We often get low quality or obsolete or chatty flags. Based on early discussions the moderators normally don't take any action and dismiss them as not requiring moderator intervention. Do you think we should continue this way or change the policy?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This seems to make sense as a policy.  But I don't have experience dealing with flags, so if Suresh or the other mods think the policy needs to be changed, I'd defer to them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *This is one of my concerns about long term health of the site. Do you consider the primary goal of this Q&amp;A site to be helping researchers in theoretical computer science and related fields to get help with their research? &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you do how should we deal with persistent trouble making users who try to abuse the site for their own wishes? E.g. users who are not researchers in theoretical computer science or any related field and insist on posting questions/answers/comments that are off-topic by the site's policies, e.g. cranks that want to use the site to verify or draw attention to their attempts on famous open problems? &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How can we make sure the site will not be overridden by users who are not researchers so cstheory does not suffer the faith of other online open resources for researchers like Usenet groups? (Keep in mind that with the current amount of community participation in closing we are going to have very serious trouble if the number of such users with 3k+ reputation reaches 5).*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The bigger such problems become, the more active moderators have to be.  So far, we've been pretty good at closing crank questions.  I would strongly prefer questions be closed by the community, and I would try to cast close votes only as fifth votes.  However, if the site gets over-run by attention-seekers and it becomes evident that the community is ill-equipped to deal with them, then I (in consultation with the other mods) would become more active in closing and deleting content.  If certain people are persistently abusing the site, they can be suspended.  If the scope of this site is to change, it should be by community discussion, not by spammers.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Searching for mathematical knowledge is quite difficult, especially when you are even a little bit away from your core field of expertise. The combined expertise of CSTheory participants is a really effective way for finding that elusive theorem, or reference.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is another role of CSTheory that I care very much about, but is harder to explain. What I have in mind is closely related to Thurston's [On Proof and Progress in Mathematics][1]. As with other fields of math, we record progress in TCS in a formal style in technical papers. We also give technical talks, and seminars. However TCS is much more than a collection of proven theorems, and algorithms. A community of researchers shares intuitions, heuristics, mental models, and all of these are essential to making progress in TCS and keeping it alive. Mind you, often these insights are specific to subfields of TCS.  These aspects of our culture are hard to capture in technical articles and talks, and we need other means of communicating them. This can be through tutorials, workshops, expository writing, monographs. And also through CSTheory. Here a researcher unfamiliar with some subfield of TCS can tap the collective wisdom of experts, ask for the intuitions and motivations behind theorems, proofs, and definitions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the flags are caused by the user's breaching community guidelines and by disrespectful behavior, I would warn them via comments. If this is not effective, and the disrespectful behavior continues, I would suspend them for a period of time. If the user's behavior makes CSTheory hostile and unwelcoming, this will likely put off many other users. The &quot;steady stream of valuable answers&quot; will not be worth losing many other valuable experts and making CSTheory unpopular. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would bring up the question in meta, so that we can both get feedback from the community. At the end of the day, community consensus should prevail, and I would of course accept the consensus decision, no matter whether I entirely agree with it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What is your personal view of the role that CSTheory should/will/does play in the greater TCS community?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To a large extent this is answered by what I wrote for the first question. In order for CSTheory to play the role I wrote about, we would need participation from experts in most of the active fields of TCS. I think there are fields where we would benefit from wider representation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Practically, one of the most important roles of a moderator, is to decide which questions to close, if at all. There are several attitudes toward this problem. Do you think that referring specifically to the user who asks the question and his or her perceived capabilities (e.g., &quot;lack of mathematical maturity&quot;, as expressed by some moderators) is a legitimate reason (or part of a reason) for closing a question? Or should you judge a question only by its own merits?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think basing decisions on the level of maturity of the user is the wrong way to go. Questions should stand on their own. It may be rare that an inexperienced user stumbles into a nice, specific enough question, but it has happened. At the end, the artefact that remains for the community is the question and the answers. And if a question is close enough, it can be edited to make it just right (but reworking questions entirely is not acceptable). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand there are questions that are so broad and vague that they do capture, almost by accident, some deep issue. It is better if such question is closed, but feedback is given to the users so that they can improve their question to focus on the interesting issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators resolve issues (by resolving flags and closing questions) that need immediate attention, and where the action to be taken is clear (in terms of broad consensus or accepted community rules). Moreover, by virtue of their role, they can and should start discussions on issues important to the community, and they should lead by example in setting standards in CSTheory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It will be a reminder to act in balanced and responsible way. But it will not change the way I answer and ask questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Binding close votes would enable me to take immediate action where such action is needed. The ability to suspend users would allow me to deal with particularly disruptive situations, in extreme cases. Moreover, the status as a moderator would allow me to lead by example in setting community standards.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We often get low quality or obsolete or chatty flags. Based on early discussions the moderators normally don't take any action and dismiss them as not requiring moderator intervention. Do you think we should continue this way or change the policy?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do agree that a low quality flag that does not point to a real issue does not require intervention. A chatty flag that does raise a legitimate concern (in a chatty way) may require attention, however. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;This is one of my concerns about long term health of the site. Do you consider the primary goal of this Q&amp;A site to be helping researchers in theoretical computer science and related fields to get help with their research?&#xD;&#xA;If you do how should we deal with persistent trouble making users who try to abuse the site for their own wishes?

(Keep in mind that with the current amount of community participation in closing we are going to have very serious trouble if the number of such users with 3k+ reputation reaches 5).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a hard question. I think the community has been good at downvoting and closing low-quality questions, and questions that clearly have an agenda that is incompatible with the goals of the site. We have also been mostly good at downvoting low-quality answers. Unfortunately, over a long period of time a user can collect a substantial amount of points from a large number of mediocre answers (say no more helpful than a Google search). The best way I can see of addressing this situation within the system is prompt moderator action in closing questions that are posted simply to draw attention to a crank's attempts at solutions of open problems. The site's tools should work fine if the level of participation from the community is high, and in order to keep the community's interest in the site we need to keep the questions on topic (research level, in TCS). Besides using the moderation tools, leaving comments on inappropriate questions, moderators could also set an example by posting questions that are at the appropriate level for CSTheory, encouraging users to post good questions/answers left in comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9404236" />

This website allows me to keep my finger on the pulse of other subfields and see what sort of questions are interesting others and how they think about certain problems. As such, I think cstheory is primarily a great way to bring the community together.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the longer term, my hope is to use the [algorithmic lens](http://egtheory.wordpress.com/2013/09/15/algorithmic-lens/) as a viewpoint on other sciences and I hope others do so as well. If non-computer scientists start using tools from cstheory then this website (and its placement among other science and math websites in the SE network) could provide a great way for us to engage with them, and share our knowledge while figuring out what problems they want to use our tools to address.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would address the specific flags through comments, discuss with the other moderators, and if the behavior persists contact the user over chat. If direct communication with the user does not resolve the issue then I would consider a suspension for some amount of time and contact over email (if such means are available).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would contact the mod in private. If after a discussion we are still unsure of the decision then I would raise the question in meta for input from the community. However, I doubt this would come up since in my experience so far I have not seen closed questions for which I disagreed with closing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What is your personal view of the role that CSTheory should/will/does play in the greater TCS community?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my answer to the first question, I described my views for this site in cstheory and the larger scientific community. I think we are already moving toward this organically, but it might help to show more clearly why cstheory is a worthwhile part of a researcher's workflow by generating more answers to lists like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [Original proofs generated on the parent site](http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/784/1037)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*[References to cstheory in the literature](http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/1257/1037)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Practically, one of the most important roles of a moderator, is to decide which questions to close, if at all. There are several attitudes toward this problem. Do you think that referring specifically to the user who asks the question and his or her perceived capabilities (e.g., &quot;lack of mathematical maturity&quot;, as expressed by some moderators) is a legitimate reason (or part of a reason) for closing a question? Or should you judge a question only by its own merits?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it is important to judge questions by their own merit. The only time I would let my knowledge of the users previous activity affect my decision is if I am unsure about the questions. However, in these cases of being unsure, I will never act before the community voices their opinion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a special case of questions that accidentally capture a deeper issue, and are simple when read at a surface level but significant at a deeper level. In this case, I think it is important to engage with the user through comments to see if this deeper exploration will serve the user, or if they were just looking for the easy answer. This is often a judgement of the users &quot;mathematical maturity&quot;. If they were not looking for a deeper discussion, and the question is fine otherwise, I would consider migration to CS.SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In your opinion, what do moderators do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators should interfere as little as possible with community self-governance, and act decisively only in clear cut cases where the community guidelines are already set. Moderators should also act as unbiased intermediaries in case of heated discussions and encourage good behavior by example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It will not change how I ask or answer questions. However, I will actively take note to make sure my comments are always unbiased, constructive, and within community norms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only differences I know is the binding vote and diamond (I guess there are also some drastic actions like suspension, but I will hopefully never have to use those). As someone that spends an unreasonable amount of time on the internet, the binding vote will allow me to act decisively and quickly in clear cut cases. Since &quot;close&quot; now means &quot;on hold&quot;, this will hopefully improve questions. The diamond will allow me to set a good example in my actions on the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We often get low quality or obsolete or chatty flags. Based on early discussions the moderators normally don't take any action and dismiss them as not requiring moderator intervention. Do you think we should continue this way or change the policy?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would encourage use of our third space (i.e. the chat room) to avoid some of the chatty discussions. However, otherwise I would leave the decision on this policy to more experienced moderators or the community (maybe we should raise a meta discussion on this?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This is one of my concerns about long term health of the site. Do you consider the primary goal of this Q&amp;A site to be helping researchers in theoretical computer science and related fields to get help with their research?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I mentioned in my first answer, I see helping researchers with their research as only part of the goals of this site. I think it is also a way to communicate with other disciplines, and a way to build community. Further, it is a way for future researchers to keep an idea of what the community is interested in, and learn from reading others questions and answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you do how should we deal with persistent trouble making users who try to abuse the site for their own wishes? E.g. users who are not researchers in theoretical computer science or any related field and insist on posting questions/answers/comments that are off-topic by the site's policies, e.g. cranks that want to use the site to verify or draw attention to their attempts on famous open problems?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We already have a [policy on crank-friendly preprints and topics](http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/274/1037), I will enforce this policy. I don't think we have gotten too many problems with cranky users, especially compared to other SE sites. We have a great community that already deals with this well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How can we make sure the site will not be overridden by users who are not researchers so cstheory does not suffer the faith of other online open resources for researchers like Usenet groups? (Keep in mind that with the current amount of community participation in closing we are going to have very serious trouble if the number of such users with 3k+ reputation reaches 5).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We can make sure of this by continuing to ask great research-level questions and providing amazing answers. However, I do agree that the reputation mechanism on the site is broken and it is easy for a persistent user to accumulate reputation. These sort of users are unavoidable, and in most cases they don't cause much trouble. However, if a specific user continually upsets the community then I will proceed as in the &quot;large number of arguments/flags&quot; question: discuss with the user and community and suspend if necessary." />

Some students might want to browse the site to decide if TCS is right for them.  Some researchers might use it as an occasional resource.  Others feel the site gives them a community they otherwise wouldn't have.  All of these seem to be valid roles for the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would resolve the flags as appropriate and comment on their inappropriate posts explaining why they are against the policy/spirit of the site.  If that doesn't help, my next steps would very much depend on the reason for the large number of flags.  If their intentions seemed genuine, I would be patient. But if it were clear, for instance, that the user is just insulting people for fun or to troll, I would consider suspending them for a period of time.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would contact the mod privately and discuss with them.  I think such problems will not be frequent here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What is your personal view of the role that CSTheory should/will/does play in the greater TCS community?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it could be (and already is) a great resource for the community.  It would be great if most TCS researchers joined this site and participated.  However, the site's role in the community may evolve organically, as these things often do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Practically, one of the most important roles of a moderator, is to decide which questions to close, if at all. There are several attitudes toward this problem. Do you think that referring specifically to the user who asks the question and his or her perceived capabilities (e.g., &quot;lack of mathematical maturity&quot;, as expressed by some moderators) is a legitimate reason (or part of a reason) for closing a question? Or should you judge a question only by its own merits?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Mostly by its own merits.  If you know that the person asking the question is, for example, a famous researcher, then it makes sense to re-evaluate the question with this in mind.  But a bad question is a bad question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In your opinion, what do moderators do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators basically should try to keep the site running smoothly with as little intervention as possible.  This involves deleting content that doesn't belong, stopping arguments that get out of hand, guiding new users, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's fine with me.  (Though if I were running the stackexchange site, I might have chosen a different design decision.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The software makes moderator votes immediately binding, so this lets them resolve egregious issues more quickly.  Of course moderators also have access even 20k users do not.  However, more importantly, because moderators are elected by the community, they can speak for the community in a way high rep users cannot.  This also means that moderators should be more careful in what they say and how they use their privileges.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We often get low quality or obsolete or chatty flags. Based on early discussions the moderators normally don't take any action and dismiss them as not requiring moderator intervention. Do you think we should continue this way or change the policy?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This seems to make sense as a policy.  But I don't have experience dealing with flags, so if Suresh or the other mods think the policy needs to be changed, I'd defer to them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This is one of my concerns about long term health of the site. Do you consider the primary goal of this Q&amp;A site to be helping researchers in theoretical computer science and related fields to get help with their research? &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you do how should we deal with persistent trouble making users who try to abuse the site for their own wishes? E.g. users who are not researchers in theoretical computer science or any related field and insist on posting questions/answers/comments that are off-topic by the site's policies, e.g. cranks that want to use the site to verify or draw attention to their attempts on famous open problems? &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How can we make sure the site will not be overridden by users who are not researchers so cstheory does not suffer the faith of other online open resources for researchers like Usenet groups? (Keep in mind that with the current amount of community participation in closing we are going to have very serious trouble if the number of such users with 3k+ reputation reaches 5).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The bigger such problems become, the more active moderators have to be.  So far, we've been pretty good at closing crank questions.  I would strongly prefer questions be closed by the community, and I would try to cast close votes only as fifth votes.  However, if the site gets over-run by attention-seekers and it becomes evident that the community is ill-equipped to deal with them, then I (in consultation with the other mods) would become more active in closing and deleting content.  If certain people are persistently abusing the site, they can be suspended.  If the scope of this site is to change, it should be by community discussion, not by spammers.&#xD;&#xA;" />

I'm not an expert in queueing theory, so you might be a better judge, but my first impression is: I don't think so.  It sounds like you are just asking a question about a calculation using queueing theory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is it a question about *theoretical computer science*?  Well, not so much.  It's more a quantitative question about distributed systems and performance modelling.  I don't see any theoretical/foundational issue here.  It *might* be OK on cstheory if it were research-level, but it looks a bit marginal to me.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, I'd recommend CS.stackexchange over CSTheory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, one other bit of feedback before you post.  I find the database stuff unclear.  OK, so we have to use a database, but you haven't told us how the database affects throughput.  What's the throughput of the database if you use a single centralized system?  What's the throughput of the database if you use a distributed system?  And does each serve do the database query in parallel with handling the request, or sequentially?  Those will affect the answer.  It's also not clear why you are telling about the costs of storage or the costs of small servers when that doesn't affect the final answer; as far as I can tell, all you are asking is how to maximize throughput, for which cost is irrelevant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, I find the question unclear and in need of clarification before it should be asked on any site." />

If you are curious, [the message quoted above was proposed to be used when a question was not research-level](http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/a/2700), so it is an abuse of this reason by all means in my opinion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you choose “off-topic” as the reason, you have an option to enter your custom reason instead of choosing one of the canned responses.  Please use it instead.  Unfortunately, a custom reason works differently from canned responses in that the custom reason is posted as a comment at the time you cast a vote, and I can imagine some circumstances in which you do not want to do this.

I have an interest in many computer science topics, but I rarely read computer science publications, have never browsed arVix, and really don't want to learn how to use such a system that I'll never use off of this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I routinely read other publications of papers by the IEEE (in fact, I have the most recent issue of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering next to me right now). Papers in this publication have &quot;index terms&quot; - keywords that describe what the paper is about. I grabbed a copy of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology out of my shelf, and they have three sections: categories and subject descriptions (which contain a code as well as textual descriptions), general terms, and additional key words/phrases. Whenever I've searched for papers in an online database, my matches have always come from the keywords sections or the body of the paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at these tags, they are unwieldy. I have no idea what the tag means, and I wouldn't expect that most undergraduate computer scientists and software engineers would either. Given the responses to [my previous question here on Meta][1], you want to be inclusive of multiple skill levels. If I find it difficult to search and browse through questions based on tags (which are also used in the site search engine), I'll be less likely to use this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of following MathOverflow, I believe that this exchange should follow a path closer to that of [Mathematics][2]. There are [three][3] [relevant][4] [discussions][5] on their Meta that I could find. The Mathematics community appears to be doing quite well in terms of having people of various skill levels (appears to range from undergraduate university-level mathematics on up), their tagging appears to be working quite well, and I honestly find it easier to read and search than MathOverflow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But really, if this Stack Exchange follows MathOverflow, I actually see someone else coming along and making another Computer Science exchange geared toward a broader audience, in terms of skill levels. I think that this exchange can avoid this splintering of the community (avoiding another Unix/Linux versus Ubuntu Stack Exchange problem) by catering to as many people of various skill levels and educational backgrounds as possible. Yes, you need a specific focus on certain topics and clearly define what is and is not on-topic, but you want to segregate based on those topics, not by knowledge or experience. By dumping the arVix style tags, you make it easy for everyone to find questions/answers, but also make the site friendlier to less knowledgeable and experienced people such as myself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that's not to say that arVix isn't useful. I believe Stack Exchanges have the &quot;tag wiki&quot; page that Stack Overflow has. It would be benefitial to identify which tags correspond to arVix topic areas and link to those topic areas in the tag wiki for a given tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, a technical consideration: The [tags are specified using rel=&quot;tag&quot;][8] in the source of a page. If you aren't familiar with microformats, search engines actually do pick up on them and they do help people find pages. People who do searches search for things like &quot;data structure&quot; and &quot;data structures&quot;, not &quot;cs.DS.data-structures&quot;. The tags should reflect what people are searching on Google and Bing so that they are brought to questions on Stack Exchanges that are relevant to their searches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also want to address a few comments and other postings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another point that I've read in [some postings and comments here][6] is that you want to maintain compatibility with MathOverflow. I think this is a mistake. MathOverflow is a Stack Exchange 1.0 site and, last I heard, had no intention of migrating to Stack Exchange 2.0. However, there are a number of Stack Exchange 2.0 sites that might be of interest to this community in some way that are at various levels of existance - Stack Overflow (people might ask algorithm or data structure implementation questions here), Mathematics (which includes discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorics...), Statistical Analysis (which includes machine learning), Not Programming Related, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Application Security, Machine Learning, Numerical Modeling and Simulation, Signal Processing, Operating systems Development, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, and Cryptography (and those are just the first 10 pages of proposals, sorted by progress). These are the communities that need to work together to decide what best belongs where, especially since it appears that there will be a feature to move questions between various Stack Exchange 2.0 sites. Unless things change on MathOverflow, you will never be able to migrate a question from here to MO. However, in the future, it will be possible to migrate questions to the exchanges I mentioned, and so far, none of them are using ArVix tagging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As [first mentioned in a comment here][7], some of the ArVix tags are long. Potentially too long to fit in the limit of a tag. The purpose of tags is to help people search and sort through questions. If you start abbreviating ArVix tags, you open up a whole new can of worms with the best way to abbreviate the tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/115&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://math.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/48/should-mathoverflow-tag-prefixes-be-used&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186/setting-things-straight-what-style-of-tags-are-we-going-to-be-using-when-we-laun&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59/mathoverflow-tags-others&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/74#74&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/42#42&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag" />

For specific questions more pertinent to this particular site, please visit the **[Official Theoretical Computer Science FAQ](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science)**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this is not bad as a starting point, there are several shortcomings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* As is often pointed out, it only mentions what theoretical computer science is and that it does not mention the expected level of questions.&#xD;&#xA;* Related to the first item, a list of alternative sites to ask questions is desirable.  The scope of our website is often better communicated by such a list.&#xD;&#xA;* The quotation is unclear about where it is quoted from.  In fact, it is originally quoted from the self-description of ACM SIGACT but it seems that SIGACT has modified this description after the text was copied, so it is kind of obsolete.  For example, the current list includes computational economics and omits the reference to VLSI, both of which are understandable.&#xD;&#xA;* I cannot see the point of emphasizing only the last sentence in the quotation from SIGACT.&#xD;&#xA;* The distinction between “general FAQs” and “official theoretical computer science FAQ” is confusing at best and makes no sense at worst.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest to revise the above text to the following.  [http://math.stackexchange.com/faq/](http://math.stackexchange.com/faq/) is written very well, and I stole part of the general structure from it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange** is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields.  We welcome _research-level_ questions in _theoretical computer science_ (TCS).&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Although there is no black-and-white distinction between research-level questions and non-research-level questions, questions are considered to be “research-level” roughly when they can be discussed between two professors or between two graduate students working on Ph.D.’s, but not usually between a professor and a typical undergraduate student.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For questions other than research-level questions in TCS, you may want to consider the following places to ask:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * Research-level mathematics — [Math Overflow](http://mathoverflow.net/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * Programming — [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * General mathematics — [Mathematics - Stack Exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/); they seem to accept also questions in TCS.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For an explanation of what TCS is, we refer you to the description of ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT):&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra.  Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor. &#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Currently we have two separate lists of FAQs.

Papers in this publication have &quot;index terms&quot; - keywords that describe what the paper is about. I grabbed a copy of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology out of my shelf, and they have three sections: categories and subject descriptions (which contain a code as well as textual descriptions), general terms, and additional key words/phrases. Whenever I've searched for papers in an online database, my matches have always come from the keywords sections or the body of the paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at these tags, they are unwieldy. I have no idea what the tag means, and I wouldn't expect that most undergraduate computer scientists and software engineers would either.

Yes, you need a specific focus on certain topics and clearly define what is and is not on-topic, but you want to segregate based on those topics, not by knowledge or experience. By dumping the arVix style tags, you make it easy for everyone to find questions/answers, but also make the site friendlier to less knowledgeable and experienced people such as myself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that's not to say that arVix isn't useful. I believe Stack Exchanges have the &quot;tag wiki&quot; page that Stack Overflow has. It would be benefitial to identify which tags correspond to arVix topic areas and link to those topic areas in the tag wiki for a given tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, a technical consideration: The [tags are specified using rel=&quot;tag&quot;][8] in the source of a page. If you aren't familiar with microformats, search engines actually do pick up on them and they do help people find pages. People who do searches search for things like &quot;data structure&quot; and &quot;data structures&quot;, not &quot;cs.DS.data-structures&quot;. The tags should reflect what people are searching on Google and Bing so that they are brought to questions on Stack Exchanges that are relevant to their searches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also want to address a few comments and other postings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another point that I've read in [some postings and comments here][6] is that you want to maintain compatibility with MathOverflow. I think this is a mistake. MathOverflow is a Stack Exchange 1.0 site and, last I heard, had no intention of migrating to Stack Exchange 2.0. However, there are a number of Stack Exchange 2.0 sites that might be of interest to this community in some way that are at various levels of existance - Stack Overflow (people might ask algorithm or data structure implementation questions here), Mathematics (which includes discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorics...), Statistical Analysis (which includes machine learning), Not Programming Related, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Application Security, Machine Learning, Numerical Modeling and Simulation, Signal Processing, Operating systems Development, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, and Cryptography (and those are just the first 10 pages of proposals, sorted by progress). These are the communities that need to work together to decide what best belongs where, especially since it appears that there will be a feature to move questions between various Stack Exchange 2.0 sites. Unless things change on MathOverflow, you will never be able to migrate a question from here to MO. However, in the future, it will be possible to migrate questions to the exchanges I mentioned, and so far, none of them are using ArVix tagging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As [first mentioned in a comment here][7], some of the ArVix tags are long. Potentially too long to fit in the limit of a tag. The purpose of tags is to help people search and sort through questions. If you start abbreviating ArVix tags, you open up a whole new can of worms with the best way to abbreviate the tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/115&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://math.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/48/should-mathoverflow-tag-prefixes-be-used&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186/setting-things-straight-what-style-of-tags-are-we-going-to-be-using-when-we-laun&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59/mathoverflow-tags-others&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/74#74&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/42#42&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag" />

I'm a software engineer, but I'm dealing with a lot of topics at work that touch on topics here - algorithms and data structures (especially performance), cryptography, stenography, security, as well as concurrent and distributed systems (but these are more from an applied standing rather than the theoretical that is more appropriate here). Even taking a look back at previous jobs, having a Stack Exchange to ask questions and provide answers about computer science topics I've encountered would have been helpful a long time ago.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If anything is going to be a problem, it's going to be scaring away people who aren't experts in the field. Honestly, I'm not that thrilled with the current state of TCS. It's following MathOverflow too closely and is catering to the experts. What makes Stack Overflow (and even Mathematics and Statistical Analysis) so great is that people of various levels of knowledge and experience are using the exact same site. The problem with MathOverflow (and TCS is going down this road) is that it focuses on the experts and the researchers. TCS does have some college students using it, but many are in a program or that deals exclusively with theoretical CS, and these people appear to be doing OK. However, people like me who have a more practical background, but are interested in the theoretical side of things without a formal education, aren't made to feel as welcome (or at least, that's the impression I get).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think part of the problem is that there is no hands on leadership. This Stack Exchange was proposed by Anand Kulkarni ([meta profile][1], [site profile][2]). Yet this user has less than 200 reputation, has only posted 3 things (1 question, 2 answers) on the main site, and has only posted 2 answers on the meta. So right from Day 1, the person who came up with this idea hasn't been involved in the site. Stack Exchange doesn't give you the tools you need to lay the framework for a site until it goes into Private Beta, and by then, it's too late for the person who came up with this idea to propose a framework of how the system works in his/her mind, since other people have already started to use the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given the focus on experts/experienced people and lack of hands on leadership (although some people are emerging as leaders, so this might turn around with the addition of moderators), I wouldn't be surprised if this Stack Exchange doesn't make it. And I think that it would be a shame if it didn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Are you pleased with the quality and interest of the questions and answers you've seen on the main site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've asked [one question][3], and I'm quite pleased with the answer I got. The way I worded my question, I didn't expect someone to take the time to write up such a detailed answer. But they did, and I'm better off because of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How well do you think we are doing at resolving issues and conflicts that arise?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this is a problem with the Stack Exchange system. The fact that there is no place for meta discussions until the site goes into private beta is a bad thing. So right now, we (and I think several Stack Exchanges have had this problem) have lots of people who read the description of the site, but then got there and were disappointed because the description didn't capture what was really happening. Because of this, everyone comes to Meta after there are already questions and answers posted on the site, time is passing, more questions/answers are being posted, and there's no agreed upon method to do things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it will get better once there are more high reputation users and moderators on the main site, but I do think that this is something that the Stack Exchange team needs to address.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/users/71/anand-kulkarni&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/71&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/585/what-is-the-difference-between-a-second-preimage-attack-and-a-collision-attack" />

The issue of down voting without commenting has been discussed extensively and the current view is that commenting is not required but encouraged.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Closing is not a big deal as is explained in the comment template says. A question can be reopened if it is deemed suitable for the site by 5 high rep members of the community. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. It is not easy to see whether a question is research-level or not unless the author of the question explains the motivation and background. It is normal to close a question which looks like non-research-level when there is not any motivation or when it seems that the author does not understand the elementary stuff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. The question you have linked to is by student working on a problem set. IIRC, the question already had a -1 vote when I posted the comment. And again as the *full* comment says:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Welcome to cstheory, a Q&amp;A site for *research-level* questions in *theoretical computer science* (TCS). Your question does not appear to be a research-level question in TCS. **Please see the [FAQ] for more information on what is meant by this and suggestions for sites that might welcome your question. Finally, if your question is closed for being out of scope, and you believe you can edit the question to make it a research-level question, please feel free to do so. Closing is not permanent and questions can be reopened, check the [FAQ] for more information.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; The FAQ also contains an item [My (wonderful!) question got closed! What do I do now?][1]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; I think we have emphasized it enough that closing is not a big deal. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. Further more, neither of the questions that you have linked to have got closed in the first place, so I am not sure if they are examples of what you are claiming. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. If you think there is nice question hidden inside a question, then you can make suggestions to the OP to improve the question, or ask a new question yourself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. The opinion at the time was that we are not closing the question too quickly, there is no problem with closing clearly off-topic questions as soon as possible. If later the question is improved to an on-topic question it can be reopened. As you could see from the state of this discussion before your new answer, it was accepted that quickly closing these questions is fine so I am not sure why you expected a change regrading in closing them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ps: next time, please start a new discussion by posting a question in place of posting an answer to an old discussion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/361#361" />

culture here &amp; sketch something out that can be used as a point for further discussion because its a direction/approach Ive been thinking about &amp; looking into &amp; even veering towards myself &amp; its key to this group. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;this question is probably a little too hypothetical. in principle you could build a paper by stringing together some stackexchange answers but it would be unusual. as mod kaveh writes, each question must stand on its own separate merit and also note, few people regularly post questions here or with high frequency esp those with high rep, and there is some possibility that frequent questions are actually informally frowned on via the voting mechanisms &amp; current collective voting tendencies. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;the pattern is more in general that high rep users answer random newcomer questions. also, it is unlikely that you would get solid answers to all the separate (presumably nontrivial) questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;basically yes, that is part of the _raison d'etre_ of the group, to occasionally collaboratively generate scientific research to theoretical computer science in general &amp; complexity theory in particular (complexity theory entries even were once highlighted here in css formatting). however the conventions around this are new &amp; still being established as we speak.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1st, use the stackexchange search engine highly extensively and also the tag system, both can be very effective. find every relevant post to your paper or subject. figure out the best knowledge that is posted on the group. figure out the border between the known and unknown and what is posted vs not posted. this also requires close familiarity with nearby papers. it helps to bookmark or &quot;favorite&quot; all related posts on here &amp; elsewhere. use the related posts column on the right also. mix this with heavy cross use of google. in some cases you may find an expert on here posting on the subj. you can look at their own answers &amp; look at their papers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;next, try posting a single carefully crafted question totally centered on your subject and your paper and what you're thinking of establishing. its a delicate mix between the general (background) and the specific (the new result/concept you're aiming for). as if you have a single chance to ask the experts what you'd most want to know but what you also most think they'd be able to answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;responses will help you figure out what is known by the crowd but also how relevant it is to this group based on reaction in form of comments, enthusiasm, voting, etc. it has to be at a &quot;just right difficulty&quot; between too easy [not research] and too hard [you wont get replies/answers]. it takes some time to find that balance &amp; its an ongoing challenge. dont assume that if there is a good answer, someone will post it. dont assume that if people post answers, those are the best possible. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;you will prob find if you are very focused that there are two gaps. one is the gap between what you want to establish in your paper and what is established in related literature. the other gap is what you can actually find out by using this group (both by searching it and posting questions). these two gaps are interrelated. you can judge whether you can build on all this with meaningful new results. but those key results will basically have to be generated by you, nobody else, unless you have found _offline_ collaborators in your own professional circles. you can use other results as a &quot;jumping off&quot; point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;so finally, leverage everything youve found and write a paper. if the answers on stackexchange are very notable and innovative, you can cite them in your paper using the stackexchange urls/&quot;cite&quot; feature. this is really not much different than citing blogs, which is occasionally done in real scientific papers. however note that this is somewhat problematic because content on here can disappear very easily due to voting, moderators, users [who can delete stuff] etc...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;probably the best and most successful model of all this invented so far is polymath[3] with a difficult problem and published arxiv paper to its credit but keep in mind this is a project started by a field medalist Gowers and promoted by his friends eg Tao and Kalai who are also very elite/accomplished theorists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1] https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/352/how-will-you-cite-a-discussion-on-this-site-in-your-paper&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[2] https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/188/how-can-we-collaboratively-investigate-open-problems?rq=1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[3] [Massively collaborative mathematics/Polymath](http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1731)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[4] https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/383/highlights-of-cstheory-stackexchange-com&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[5] https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/697/what-interesting-open-problems-have-been-asked-on-this-stackexchange&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[6] https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1316/attacking-open-questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[7] https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1257/references-to-cstheory-in-the-literature&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[8] https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/784/original-proofs-generated-on-the-parent-site&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[9] [Questions answered. in theory.](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~suresh/cstheory.pdf)&#xD;&#xA;(early tcs.se ad &amp;

It would be nice if the moderators here would avoid migrating low-quality questions to CS.SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I noticed recently a few low-quality questions that were migrated to the Computer Science Stack Exchange (CS.SE) site.  I would suggest that we avoid doing that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If it's a good question, and on-topic for CS.SE, I definitely encourage you to migrate to CS.SE.  For instance, if it is not research-level but would be a reasonable question, migrating to CS.SE is a great idea.  Go for it!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* But if it's a bad question -- one that would be a bad question for CS.SE -- please don't migrate it to CS.SE.  If it's a bad question, just close it, don't migrate it.  Please don't make CS.SE a dumping ground for bad questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If it's a good question -- well-researched, on-topic, focused, narrow -- but has some English/grammar problems, don't let that stop you from migrating.  If it's just the English, we can edit it over at CS.SE.  But if it is a fundamentally bad question -- e.g., not well-researched, or a duplicate, or unclear -- I personally don't think it should be migrated over to CS.SE&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One recent example: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18536/5038.  In my opinion, that question shouldn't have been migrated to CS.SE.  It is not a good fit for the Computer Science Stack Exchange.  The question does not show evidence of effort.  It asks a question about a topic that is already covered by reference questions at CS.SE, with no evidence that the question-asker was aware of that.  These issues are not something that those of us at CS.SE can fix through simple edits to the question.  Of course, that's just one example.  I don't mean to pick on that one or focus on that one too much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Kaveh explains that the CS.SE admins specifically requested that &quot;badly written&quot; questions are still OK to migrate to CS.SE.  I didn't realize that!  That explains a lot.  Perhaps that's something we should discuss.  I'm not sure whether &quot;badly written&quot; refers to the English/grammar, or to more fundamental issues (like whether it's a good question, whether it is well-researched, whether it is on-topic and focused and detailed and not a duplicate).  If the former, I agree, English/grammar problems should not be a barrier to migration.  If the latter, well, I guess I might have a slight difference of opinion with the CS.SE admins -- maybe that's something we need to discuss on CS.meta, instead of here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I certainly don't mean to imply that this is a huge, systemic problem that requires major changes to migration, and I don't mean to imply the moderators here are doing anything wrong (I think the moderators are doing a great job!).

It seems that most people disagree, and I started to feel that it is a waste of time to try to convince people otherwise.  For now, I still hesitate to vote for off topic (or to be listed as one of the people who closed the question as off topic) when I see too elementary a question, so probably I will not vote to close it.  Hopefully there are enough people to close it anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When we vote to close a question, we choose the reason from several choices.  It seems that if a question is too elementary, it is often closed for the reason “off topic.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I understand that this choice of reason is based on the consensus about the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  However, if a question is closed for the reason “off topic,” the following explanation is added to the question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; closed as off topic by [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone] [Date]&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Questions on Theoretical Computer Science are expected to generally relate to Theoretical Computer Science, within the scope defined in the [faq](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have trouble even parsing this sentence because of the tentative name of the website, but more importantly this does not mention the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  It plainly states that the question is not related to the theoretical computer science, which is often false.  This gives the false impression that we take the theoretical computer science very narrowly.  I think that this is problematic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(_Added in revision 5_: The link in the explanation quoted above links to the [built-in FAQ](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq), not to the [FAQ on Meta](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science).  The built-in FAQ is not clear about the expected level of questions, either, except that the sentence “Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields” may suggest that research-level questions are expected.  A clearer statement can be reached by the following chain of links: the explanation of “off topic” → [built-in FAQ](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq) → [FAQ on Meta](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science) → [What kind of questions are too basic?](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235)  But I doubt that users can find this path unless they are already familiar with the website.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What should we do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few suggestions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. If the consensus is really that cstheory.stackexchange.com is for questions of at least certain level, the explanation of the reason “off topic” should be rewritten to reflect it.  Is this possible?&#xD;&#xA;2. &lt;del&gt;On [MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/), too elementary questions are often closed for the reason “too localized.”  Obviously this is an abuse and [it certainly confuses some users](http://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/274/what-does-too-localized-mean-exactly/), but it is possible to interpret it as “This question is so elementary that it is useful only for the asker,” and it is understandable (or at least less prone to misunderstanding).  How about adopting this convention, at least until the explanation of “off topic” is modified to a better description?&lt;/del&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- See a [related FAQ entry](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235) and the links given there for discussions about what we mean by “too elementary.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_Added in revision 4:_ Whereas the description of the close reason is not shown on the question page on MathOverflow, it is shown on cstheory.stackexchange.com, which may make abusing harder.  Here is the description of the close reason “too localized”:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This question would only be relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The point of the suggestion 2 above is that it is at least possible to argue that too elementary questions fall into the third group (and possibly also the second group) of this description.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Currently the majority of participants are graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, but the number of senior researchers active within the site is growing quickly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though [cs.theory.stackexchange.com](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/) is only two months old, it can already boast of 2,000 registered users, 700 answered questions, and -- perhaps most exciting -- [new research collaborations among computer scientists](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2328/when-should-you-say-what-you-know/2362#2362) who otherwise might never have realized that they were working on related problems.

This effort made it clear that the worldwide theoretical computer science community was ready for -- and needed -- a structured way to ask research-level questions and to consider answers to such questions.  The success of MathOverflow.net (a site devoted to research-level mathematics) encouraged us to adopt the StackExchange software developed by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. This software provides a user reputation system built on up- and down-voting of contributions to highlight and encourage high quality, and to control spam.  There is also a [&quot;Meta&quot; area][15], for discussions about site scope and direction. Thus far, the system has worked extremely well and we are very pleased with it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Who runs the site?###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You do ! The site is moderated by the community, with users gaining access to more management tools as they gain more reputation within the site. We have an active core of users who diligently monitor the site, help improve the quality of questions and answers, and filter out spam. In fact, this very article is a product of community participation on the site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But you don't have to worry about any of that to contribute to the numerous research discussions taking place right now.

I like this modern look.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few comments:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Logo&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To be honest, I do not think the uppercase sigma is ideal as a logo.  The uppercase sigma is strongly related to discrete mathematics (because the symbol is used for summation), and it is true that theoretical computer science uses discrete mathematics a lot, but theoretical computer science is not the same as discrete mathematics.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, without a better alternative, the uppercase sigma is an acceptable compromise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I like the [DFA idea](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/33/what-should-our-logo-be/314#314) as is used in Suresh’s publicity materials, but it will not be recognizable in a 16×16-pixel favicon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Typewriter font&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I like the use of typewriter font in the website title written on a tape of a Turing machine.  On the other hand, as Suresh said, I am worried about the use of typewriter font in question titles, too, but for a different reason.  Some of the question titles are long, and typewriter font takes too much width.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do not think that a mix of two fonts is bad by itself.

It has been observed that this idea can even tackle the [beginners forum][2] issue (though I am not sure that would be a good idea).  One major impediment is that the current software does not support such an idea, so the SE people would have to put in considerable effort to make it happen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The idea went as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I think it would be great to have a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; CS stackexchange site that had&#xD;&#xA;&gt; multiple &quot;forums&quot; (for the different&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fields of CS) like cstheory. The&#xD;&#xA;&gt; membership could be shared. The&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reputation points could transfer&#xD;&#xA;&gt; across the forums.

This would increase the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; user base as users from all the forums&#xD;&#xA;&gt; would occasionally do some browsing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and answering each others' questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The response seems to have been positive.

I ask people here to help (re)create one on Area51, and support it adequately.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;PS: There's always an issue of homeworks: Professors don't like their students to *cheat* by asking homework problems in online forums.

Too much personal tone can be distracting, and reducing the personal tone can improve the readability of a question (or perhaps also an answer).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this particular example, the question before the edit sounds a little like a diary rather than a question written as a question from the beginning.  It is fine in a blog, but it is probably suboptimal on a Q&amp;A website.  I guess that this is why Kaveh felt the need for an edit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, in this particular example, I do not think that it was done well.  I do not like the opening after the edit:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There is always a way for application in topics related to theoretical computer science.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Despite the intent of the edit which Kaveh explained, this does not sound like a professional to me.  Instead, it sounds like some newbie who tries to pretend to be a professional.  Frankly speaking, the question sounded at least honest before the edit, but it sounds pretentious after the edit.  I am sorry, but I do not like how the question is stated after the edit at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, it should be pointed out that [we encourage to include a personal motivation in a question](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/300/how-to-ask-a-good-question/306#306): we want a question which the asker cares out of his/her own interest rather than a question which the asker thinks that someone cares.  In this sense, good questions necessarily contain some personal part.  I do not think that it is right to remove everything personal from a question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thinking this way, it seems very difficult to edit a question to reduce the personal tone while maintaining some degree of personality.  If you do it, you should do it right.  I guess that it is a perfectly reasonable choice to give up such a difficult task and just either leave the question open or close it.&#xD;&#xA;" />

We have discussed previously (see [this](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1264/) and [this](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1395/)) that we are not going to require or even demand people to explain their votes. When I see a down-vote that I don't understand I politely comment that I don't understand it, but I think demanding an explanation or stating that there is no reason for the down-vote goes too far. It is not an abuse if people are using their votes in a way different from us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have argued a number of times that I am against counter-voting, that is voting to null the effect of another user's vote. Everyone has their own opinion. The total reflects the opinion of the community, it is not the job of any particular user to decide what the total should be. Counter-voting encourages other users to do the same and use their votes to null votes in place of express their opinion about the question. Each vote is a manifestation of some user's opinion and if we respect their opinions then we should respect their votes even when we disagree with them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it is more productive if we comment and explain why we think it is a suitable and interesting question in place of just asking others why they have down-voted the post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this particular case, I see several possible reasons for a down-vote. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Formating: It is using an image in place of writing the expression which I think has been one of the reasons people down-vote. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Content: The questions seems to simply ask how to calculate some expression for some particular values. It seems to ask how to apply a method explained in a paper in a particular case in practice. It is too localized and it doesn't seem to be a _research-level_ question in _theoretical_ computer science. It is also unclear what is the trouble the OP is facing in calculating the expression.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ask me I think we are being too open right now (I guess it is partly because people get bored that there are not as many questions as they would like) to questions which should not be here and are more suitable for CS.SE.

This website allows me to keep my finger on the pulse of other subfields and see what sort of questions are interesting others and how they think about certain problems. As such, I think cstheory is primarily a great way to bring the community together.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the longer term, my hope is to use the [algorithmic lens](http://egtheory.wordpress.com/2013/09/15/algorithmic-lens/) as a viewpoint on other sciences and I hope others do so as well. If non-computer scientists start using tools from cstheory then this website (and its placement among other science and math websites in the SE network) could provide a great way for us to engage with them, and share our knowledge while figuring out what problems they want to use our tools to address.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would address the specific flags through comments, discuss with the other moderators, and if the behavior persists contact the user over chat. If direct communication with the user does not resolve the issue then I would consider a suspension for some amount of time and contact over email (if such means are available).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would contact the mod in private. If after a discussion we are still unsure of the decision then I would raise the question in meta for input from the community. However, I doubt this would come up since in my experience so far I have not seen closed questions for which I disagreed with closing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What is your personal view of the role that CSTheory should/will/does play in the greater TCS community?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my answer to the first question, I described my views for this site in cstheory and the larger scientific community. I think we are already moving toward this organically, but it might help to show more clearly why cstheory is a worthwhile part of a researcher's workflow by generating more answers to lists like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [Original proofs generated on the parent site](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/784/1037)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*[References to cstheory in the literature](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1257/1037)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Practically, one of the most important roles of a moderator, is to decide which questions to close, if at all. There are several attitudes toward this problem. Do you think that referring specifically to the user who asks the question and his or her perceived capabilities (e.g., &quot;lack of mathematical maturity&quot;, as expressed by some moderators) is a legitimate reason (or part of a reason) for closing a question? Or should you judge a question only by its own merits?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it is important to judge questions by their own merit. The only time I would let my knowledge of the users previous activity affect my decision is if I am unsure about the questions. However, in these cases of being unsure, I will never act before the community voices their opinion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a special case of questions that accidentally capture a deeper issue, and are simple when read at a surface level but significant at a deeper level. In this case, I think it is important to engage with the user through comments to see if this deeper exploration will serve the user, or if they were just looking for the easy answer. This is often a judgement of the users &quot;mathematical maturity&quot;. If they were not looking for a deeper discussion, and the question is fine otherwise, I would consider migration to CS.SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In your opinion, what do moderators do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderators should interfere as little as possible with community self-governance, and act decisively only in clear cut cases where the community guidelines are already set. Moderators should also act as unbiased intermediaries in case of heated discussions and encourage good behavior by example.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It will not change how I ask or answer questions. However, I will actively take note to make sure my comments are always unbiased, constructive, and within community norms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only differences I know is the binding vote and diamond (I guess there are also some drastic actions like suspension, but I will hopefully never have to use those). As someone that spends an unreasonable amount of time on the internet, the binding vote will allow me to act decisively and quickly in clear cut cases. Since &quot;close&quot; now means &quot;on hold&quot;, this will hopefully improve questions. The diamond will allow me to set a good example in my actions on the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We often get low quality or obsolete or chatty flags. Based on early discussions the moderators normally don't take any action and dismiss them as not requiring moderator intervention. Do you think we should continue this way or change the policy?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would encourage use of our third space (i.e. the chat room) to avoid some of the chatty discussions. However, otherwise I would leave the decision on this policy to more experienced moderators or the community (maybe we should raise a meta discussion on this?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This is one of my concerns about long term health of the site. Do you consider the primary goal of this Q&amp;A site to be helping researchers in theoretical computer science and related fields to get help with their research?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I mentioned in my first answer, I see helping researchers with their research as only part of the goals of this site. I think it is also a way to communicate with other disciplines, and a way to build community. Further, it is a way for future researchers to keep an idea of what the community is interested in, and learn from reading others questions and answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you do how should we deal with persistent trouble making users who try to abuse the site for their own wishes? E.g. users who are not researchers in theoretical computer science or any related field and insist on posting questions/answers/comments that are off-topic by the site's policies, e.g. cranks that want to use the site to verify or draw attention to their attempts on famous open problems?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We already have a [policy on crank-friendly preprints and topics](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/274/1037), I will enforce this policy. I don't think we have gotten too many problems with cranky users, especially compared to other SE sites. We have a great community that already deals with this well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How can we make sure the site will not be overridden by users who are not researchers so cstheory does not suffer the faith of other online open resources for researchers like Usenet groups? (Keep in mind that with the current amount of community participation in closing we are going to have very serious trouble if the number of such users with 3k+ reputation reaches 5).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We can make sure of this by continuing to ask great research-level questions and providing amazing answers. However, I do agree that the reputation mechanism on the site is broken and it is easy for a persistent user to accumulate reputation. These sort of users are unavoidable, and in most cases they don't cause much trouble. However, if a specific user continually upsets the community then I will proceed as in the &quot;large number of arguments/flags&quot; question: discuss with the user and community and suspend if necessary." />

It would be nice if the moderators here would avoid migrating low-quality questions to CS.SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I noticed recently a few low-quality questions that were migrated to the Computer Science Stack Exchange (CS.SE) site.  I would suggest that we avoid doing that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If it's a good question, and on-topic for CS.SE, I definitely encourage you to migrate to CS.SE.  For instance, if it is not research-level but would be a reasonable question, migrating to CS.SE is a great idea.  Go for it!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* But if it's a bad question -- one that would be a bad question for CS.SE -- please don't migrate it to CS.SE.  If it's a bad question, just close it, don't migrate it.  Please don't make CS.SE a dumping ground for bad questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If it's a good question -- well-researched, on-topic, focused, narrow -- but has some English/grammar problems, don't let that stop you from migrating.  If it's just the English, we can edit it over at CS.SE.  But if it is a fundamentally bad question -- e.g., not well-researched, or a duplicate, or unclear -- I personally don't think it should be migrated over to CS.SE&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One recent example: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18536/5038.  In my opinion, that question shouldn't have been migrated to CS.SE.  It is not a good fit for the Computer Science Stack Exchange.  The question does not show evidence of effort.  It asks a question about a topic that is already covered by reference questions at CS.SE, with no evidence that the question-asker was aware of that.  These issues are not something that those of us at CS.SE can fix through simple edits to the question.  Of course, that's just one example.  I don't mean to pick on that one or focus on that one too much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Kaveh explains that the CS.SE admins specifically requested that &quot;badly written&quot; questions are still OK to migrate to CS.SE.  I didn't realize that!  That explains a lot.  Perhaps that's something we should discuss.  I'm not sure whether &quot;badly written&quot; refers to the English/grammar, or to more fundamental issues (like whether it's a good question, whether it is well-researched, whether it is on-topic and focused and detailed and not a duplicate).  If the former, I agree, English/grammar problems should not be a barrier to migration.  If the latter, well, I guess I might have a slight difference of opinion with the CS.SE admins -- maybe that's something we need to discuss on CS.meta, instead of here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I certainly don't mean to imply that this is a huge, systemic problem that requires major changes to migration, and I don't mean to imply the moderators here are doing anything wrong (I think the moderators are doing a great job!).  Overall I think the process is generally working well.  I just wanted to suggest a minor refinement that I think might make things work better on CS.SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1086/5038&#xD;&#xA;* https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1285/5038&#xD;&#xA;* https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1507/5038&#xD;&#xA;* [Do we want CSTheory.SE to migrate bad questions over here?](https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/691/755)" />

It seems that most people disagree, and I started to feel that it is a waste of time to try to convince people otherwise.  For now, I still hesitate to vote for off topic (or to be listed as one of the people who closed the question as off topic) when I see too elementary a question, so probably I will not vote to close it.  Hopefully there are enough people to close it anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When we vote to close a question, we choose the reason from several choices.  It seems that if a question is too elementary, it is often closed for the reason “off topic.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I understand that this choice of reason is based on the consensus about the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  However, if a question is closed for the reason “off topic,” the following explanation is added to the question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; closed as off topic by [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone] [Date]&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Questions on Theoretical Computer Science are expected to generally relate to Theoretical Computer Science, within the scope defined in the [faq](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have trouble even parsing this sentence because of the tentative name of the website, but more importantly this does not mention the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  It plainly states that the question is not related to the theoretical computer science, which is often false.  This gives the false impression that we take the theoretical computer science very narrowly.  I think that this is problematic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(_Added in revision 5_: The link in the explanation quoted above links to the [built-in FAQ](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq), not to the [FAQ on Meta](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science).  The built-in FAQ is not clear about the expected level of questions, either, except that the sentence “Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields” may suggest that research-level questions are expected.  A clearer statement can be reached by the following chain of links: the explanation of “off topic” → [built-in FAQ](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq) → [FAQ on Meta](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science) → [What kind of questions are too basic?](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235)  But I doubt that users can find this path unless they are already familiar with the website.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What should we do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few suggestions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. If the consensus is really that cstheory.stackexchange.com is for questions of at least certain level, the explanation of the reason “off topic” should be rewritten to reflect it.  Is this possible?&#xD;&#xA;2. &lt;del&gt;On [MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/), too elementary questions are often closed for the reason “too localized.”  Obviously this is an abuse and [it certainly confuses some users](https://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/274/what-does-too-localized-mean-exactly/), but it is possible to interpret it as “This question is so elementary that it is useful only for the asker,” and it is understandable (or at least less prone to misunderstanding).  How about adopting this convention, at least until the explanation of “off topic” is modified to a better description?&lt;/del&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- See a [related FAQ entry](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235) and the links given there for discussions about what we mean by “too elementary.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_Added in revision 4:_ Whereas the description of the close reason is not shown on the question page on MathOverflow, it is shown on cstheory.stackexchange.com, which may make abusing harder.  Here is the description of the close reason “too localized”:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This question would only be relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The point of the suggestion 2 above is that it is at least possible to argue that too elementary questions fall into the third group (and possibly also the second group) of this description.&#xD;&#xA;" />

While I try to judge this proposal on its own merit, it is likely that the time and energy I have invested in CS.SE influences me.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm afraid that broadening the scope in this way would destroy the existing community. A Stack Exchange site is defined by two things: the kind of questions it accepts, and the audience it attracts. Even though each question is in principle judged on its intrinsic merits, the long-term effect is to create a community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On this site, the community is centered around researchers in theoretical computer science. Participants tend to be researchers in TCS, researchers in other fields, or graduate students aspiring to become researchers. The participants who are welcomed are generally those who came with the expectation of participating in a community dominated by TCS researchers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do not see a problem with allowing more applied questions. As long as academics and people who want to fit in with academics dominate the site, that isn't a problem. It may be difficult to bootstrap an applied CS community (it would have been a lot easier to do when the site was young), but if it works, it won't change the tone of the site, and if it fails, the site won't have changed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, opening the door to more basic questions means opening the door to a broader audience. This should be a carefully controlled process. In particular, I advise you not to try to draw on Stack Overflow as an audience base. A majority of Stack Overflow does not know or care what it means to be a scientist. The kind of people you would attract are those who now post on [Programmers](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/). If you attract those people, be prepared to moderate their content. And to moderate them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Reacting to specific points in your proposal:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We now have a natural forum (cs.stackexchange.com) for the more &quot;basic&quot; algorithms questions, and the cstheory &quot;brand&quot; is well established as a 'research-only' venue. So we have an easy process to shunt questions that are obviously undergrad level.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind that CS.SE is not exclusively for basic questions. It is for questions at all level, ranging all the way from CS 101 homework to applied research (and even research in theory, but we suggest CSTheory.SE to the rare asker who comes with a theory question that seems to go unanswered because it is too hard).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; excluding questions from people who might be 'research-level' in a sub area but aren't experts in some other domain&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From what I see (I admit to not following CSTheory.SE very closely), this already happens: as long as there's a feeling that peers are talking with peers, questions tend to be appreciated, left open and answered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; creating the impression of an unfriendly site (which is a bigger problem in terms of maintaining the audience)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the community is doing an adequate job of retaining the audience it likes in and keeping the undesirables in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All in all, while the current guidelines may be stricter than this, I think an intelligent application of the existing policies already gives you what you want.&#xD;&#xA;" />

I have an interest in many computer science topics, but I rarely read computer science publications, have never browsed arVix, and really don't want to learn how to use such a system that I'll never use off of this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I routinely read other publications of papers by the IEEE (in fact, I have the most recent issue of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering next to me right now). Papers in this publication have &quot;index terms&quot; - keywords that describe what the paper is about. I grabbed a copy of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology out of my shelf, and they have three sections: categories and subject descriptions (which contain a code as well as textual descriptions), general terms, and additional key words/phrases. Whenever I've searched for papers in an online database, my matches have always come from the keywords sections or the body of the paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at these tags, they are unwieldy. I have no idea what the tag means, and I wouldn't expect that most undergraduate computer scientists and software engineers would either. Given the responses to [my previous question here on Meta][1], you want to be inclusive of multiple skill levels. If I find it difficult to search and browse through questions based on tags (which are also used in the site search engine), I'll be less likely to use this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of following MathOverflow, I believe that this exchange should follow a path closer to that of [Mathematics][2]. There are [three][3] [relevant][4] [discussions][5] on their Meta that I could find. The Mathematics community appears to be doing quite well in terms of having people of various skill levels (appears to range from undergraduate university-level mathematics on up), their tagging appears to be working quite well, and I honestly find it easier to read and search than MathOverflow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But really, if this Stack Exchange follows MathOverflow, I actually see someone else coming along and making another Computer Science exchange geared toward a broader audience, in terms of skill levels. I think that this exchange can avoid this splintering of the community (avoiding another Unix/Linux versus Ubuntu Stack Exchange problem) by catering to as many people of various skill levels and educational backgrounds as possible. Yes, you need a specific focus on certain topics and clearly define what is and is not on-topic, but you want to segregate based on those topics, not by knowledge or experience. By dumping the arVix style tags, you make it easy for everyone to find questions/answers, but also make the site friendlier to less knowledgeable and experienced people such as myself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that's not to say that arVix isn't useful. I believe Stack Exchanges have the &quot;tag wiki&quot; page that Stack Overflow has. It would be benefitial to identify which tags correspond to arVix topic areas and link to those topic areas in the tag wiki for a given tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, a technical consideration: The [tags are specified using rel=&quot;tag&quot;][8] in the source of a page. If you aren't familiar with microformats, search engines actually do pick up on them and they do help people find pages. People who do searches search for things like &quot;data structure&quot; and &quot;data structures&quot;, not &quot;cs.DS.data-structures&quot;. The tags should reflect what people are searching on Google and Bing so that they are brought to questions on Stack Exchanges that are relevant to their searches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also want to address a few comments and other postings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another point that I've read in [some postings and comments here][6] is that you want to maintain compatibility with MathOverflow. I think this is a mistake. MathOverflow is a Stack Exchange 1.0 site and, last I heard, had no intention of migrating to Stack Exchange 2.0. However, there are a number of Stack Exchange 2.0 sites that might be of interest to this community in some way that are at various levels of existance - Stack Overflow (people might ask algorithm or data structure implementation questions here), Mathematics (which includes discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorics...), Statistical Analysis (which includes machine learning), Not Programming Related, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Application Security, Machine Learning, Numerical Modeling and Simulation, Signal Processing, Operating systems Development, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, and Cryptography (and those are just the first 10 pages of proposals, sorted by progress). These are the communities that need to work together to decide what best belongs where, especially since it appears that there will be a feature to move questions between various Stack Exchange 2.0 sites. Unless things change on MathOverflow, you will never be able to migrate a question from here to MO.

For specific questions more pertinent to this particular site, please visit the **[Official Theoretical Computer Science FAQ](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science)**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this is not bad as a starting point, there are several shortcomings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* As is often pointed out, it only mentions what theoretical computer science is and that it does not mention the expected level of questions.&#xD;&#xA;* Related to the first item, a list of alternative sites to ask questions is desirable.  The scope of our website is often better communicated by such a list.&#xD;&#xA;* The quotation is unclear about where it is quoted from.  In fact, it is originally quoted from the self-description of ACM SIGACT but it seems that SIGACT has modified this description after the text was copied, so it is kind of obsolete.  For example, the current list includes computational economics and omits the reference to VLSI, both of which are understandable.&#xD;&#xA;* I cannot see the point of emphasizing only the last sentence in the quotation from SIGACT.&#xD;&#xA;* The distinction between “general FAQs” and “official theoretical computer science FAQ” is confusing at best and makes no sense at worst.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest to revise the above text to the following.  [https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/](https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/) is written very well, and I stole part of the general structure from it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange** is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields.

The scope of cstheory is research-level. Questions that are at the level of difficulty of typical undergraduate students are not part of the scope. There are other Q&amp;A sites which have a more general scope like [Math.SE][1] that would welcome questions from students.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Votes (down and up) are one of the main ways users express their opinion about the quality of a question and how interesting it is. A user may down vote a question if she/he thinks the question is off-topic or has other problems (e.g. unclear, not answerable in its current form, argumentative, not a real question, post to solicit opinion, ...).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;If you want to know why [your question](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/8826/is-halting-that-hard-yes) is down voted you can ask for that in place of attacking other users. I will explain my down vote in more detail below:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems to me that you are trying to find a way to get around the undecidability of halting problem. The halting problem (as it is defined in the literature) is undecidable and that is a mathematical theorem. Now one might be interested in decidable variations of halting problem. That is a well studied topic, and one can ask a research level question about that. There are also researchers working on these kind of problems who try to find ways to deal with undecidability in practice (mainly in formal methods community, but also in theoretical computer science). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand your question has no sign that you are familiar with the literature. I can tell that this is something a typical undergraduate student taking their first course in computability would ask. It is nice that a student would think about this kind of problems. But everything has a place and the place of this question is not cstheory. If you ask it on Math.SE you probably will not get any down votes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As an analogy, it is completely fine and even encouraged that students ask questions like this in an undergraduate computability class from the instructor. Asking it in a research-level computability workshop will probably be unwelcome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ask a question about halting problem and show that you are familiar with the literature and understand the basics in the area, and the question is a real question (posting a question to see how others think about your idea about how to solve halting problem is not a real question) and is clearly stated (can be answered without much back-and-forth comments where others try to guess what you want to ask, which can be a sign that the question is not well-thought), then that can be on-topic and I would guess would not receive any down votes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ps:&#xD;&#xA;I would suggest that you take a look at the [this section of the FAQ](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq#questions-should-be-based-on-knowledge-sharing-not-on-shirking) and also the pages linked there. Following those suggestions would increase the chance that your questions are well perceived by the community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://math.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq" />

It seems that most people disagree, and I started to feel that it is a waste of time to try to convince people otherwise.  For now, I still hesitate to vote for off topic (or to be listed as one of the people who closed the question as off topic) when I see too elementary a question, so probably I will not vote to close it.  Hopefully there are enough people to close it anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When we vote to close a question, we choose the reason from several choices.  It seems that if a question is too elementary, it is often closed for the reason “off topic.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I understand that this choice of reason is based on the consensus about the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  However, if a question is closed for the reason “off topic,” the following explanation is added to the question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; closed as off topic by [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone] [Date]&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Questions on Theoretical Computer Science are expected to generally relate to Theoretical Computer Science, within the scope defined in the [faq](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have trouble even parsing this sentence because of the tentative name of the website, but more importantly this does not mention the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  It plainly states that the question is not related to the theoretical computer science, which is often false.  This gives the false impression that we take the theoretical computer science very narrowly.  I think that this is problematic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(_Added in revision 5_: The link in the explanation quoted above links to the [built-in FAQ](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq), not to the [FAQ on Meta](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science).  The built-in FAQ is not clear about the expected level of questions, either, except that the sentence “Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields” may suggest that research-level questions are expected.  A clearer statement can be reached by the following chain of links: the explanation of “off topic” → [built-in FAQ](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq) → [FAQ on Meta](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science) → [What kind of questions are too basic?](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235)  But I doubt that users can find this path unless they are already familiar with the website.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What should we do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few suggestions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. If the consensus is really that cstheory.stackexchange.com is for questions of at least certain level, the explanation of the reason “off topic” should be rewritten to reflect it.  Is this possible?&#xD;&#xA;2. &lt;del&gt;On [MathOverflow](http://mathoverflow.net/), too elementary questions are often closed for the reason “too localized.”  Obviously this is an abuse and [it certainly confuses some users](https://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/274/what-does-too-localized-mean-exactly/), but it is possible to interpret it as “This question is so elementary that it is useful only for the asker,” and it is understandable (or at least less prone to misunderstanding).  How about adopting this convention, at least until the explanation of “off topic” is modified to a better description?&lt;/del&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- See a [related FAQ entry](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235) and the links given there for discussions about what we mean by “too elementary.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_Added in revision 4:_ Whereas the description of the close reason is not shown on the question page on MathOverflow, it is shown on cstheory.stackexchange.com, which may make abusing harder.  Here is the description of the close reason “too localized”:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This question would only be relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The point of the suggestion 2 above is that it is at least possible to argue that too elementary questions fall into the third group (and possibly also the second group) of this description.&#xD;&#xA;" />

What makes Stack Overflow (and even Mathematics and Statistical Analysis) so great is that people of various levels of knowledge and experience are using the exact same site. The problem with MathOverflow (and TCS is going down this road) is that it focuses on the experts and the researchers. TCS does have some college students using it, but many are in a program or that deals exclusively with theoretical CS, and these people appear to be doing OK. However, people like me who have a more practical background, but are interested in the theoretical side of things without a formal education, aren't made to feel as welcome (or at least, that's the impression I get).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think part of the problem is that there is no hands on leadership. This Stack Exchange was proposed by Anand Kulkarni ([meta profile][1], [site profile][2]). Yet this user has less than 200 reputation, has only posted 3 things (1 question, 2 answers) on the main site, and has only posted 2 answers on the meta. So right from Day 1, the person who came up with this idea hasn't been involved in the site. Stack Exchange doesn't give you the tools you need to lay the framework for a site until it goes into Private Beta, and by then, it's too late for the person who came up with this idea to propose a framework of how the system works in his/her mind, since other people have already started to use the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given the focus on experts/experienced people and lack of hands on leadership (although some people are emerging as leaders, so this might turn around with the addition of moderators), I wouldn't be surprised if this Stack Exchange doesn't make it. And I think that it would be a shame if it didn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Are you pleased with the quality and interest of the questions and answers you've seen on the main site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've asked [one question][3], and I'm quite pleased with the answer I got. The way I worded my question, I didn't expect someone to take the time to write up such a detailed answer. But they did, and I'm better off because of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How well do you think we are doing at resolving issues and conflicts that arise?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this is a problem with the Stack Exchange system. The fact that there is no place for meta discussions until the site goes into private beta is a bad thing. So right now, we (and I think several Stack Exchanges have had this problem) have lots of people who read the description of the site, but then got there and were disappointed because the description didn't capture what was really happening. Because of this, everyone comes to Meta after there are already questions and answers posted on the site, time is passing, more questions/answers are being posted, and there's no agreed upon method to do things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it will get better once there are more high reputation users and moderators on the main site, but I do think that this is something that the Stack Exchange team needs to address.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/users/71/anand-kulkarni&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/71&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/585/what-is-the-difference-between-a-second-preimage-attack-and-a-collision-attack" />

It would be nice if the moderators here would avoid migrating low-quality questions to CS.SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I noticed recently a few low-quality questions that were migrated to the Computer Science Stack Exchange (CS.SE) site.  I would suggest that we avoid doing that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If it's a good question, and on-topic for CS.SE, I definitely encourage you to migrate to CS.SE.  For instance, if it is not research-level but would be a reasonable question, migrating to CS.SE is a great idea.  Go for it!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* But if it's a bad question -- one that would be a bad question for CS.SE -- please don't migrate it to CS.SE.  If it's a bad question, just close it, don't migrate it.  Please don't make CS.SE a dumping ground for bad questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If it's a good question -- well-researched, on-topic, focused, narrow -- but has some English/grammar problems, don't let that stop you from migrating.  If it's just the English, we can edit it over at CS.SE.  But if it is a fundamentally bad question -- e.g., not well-researched, or a duplicate, or unclear -- I personally don't think it should be migrated over to CS.SE&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One recent example: https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18536/5038.  In my opinion, that question shouldn't have been migrated to CS.SE.  It is not a good fit for the Computer Science Stack Exchange.  The question does not show evidence of effort.  It asks a question about a topic that is already covered by reference questions at CS.SE, with no evidence that the question-asker was aware of that.  These issues are not something that those of us at CS.SE can fix through simple edits to the question.  Of course, that's just one example.  I don't mean to pick on that one or focus on that one too much.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Kaveh explains that the CS.SE admins specifically requested that &quot;badly written&quot; questions are still OK to migrate to CS.SE.  I didn't realize that!  That explains a lot.  Perhaps that's something we should discuss.  I'm not sure whether &quot;badly written&quot; refers to the English/grammar, or to more fundamental issues (like whether it's a good question, whether it is well-researched, whether it is on-topic and focused and detailed and not a duplicate).  If the former, I agree, English/grammar problems should not be a barrier to migration.  If the latter, well, I guess I might have a slight difference of opinion with the CS.SE admins -- maybe that's something we need to discuss on CS.meta, instead of here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I certainly don't mean to imply that this is a huge, systemic problem that requires major changes to migration, and I don't mean to imply the moderators here are doing anything wrong (I think the moderators are doing a great job!).  Overall I think the process is generally working well.  I just wanted to suggest a minor refinement that I think might make things work better on CS.SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1086/5038&#xD;&#xA;* https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1285/5038&#xD;&#xA;* https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1507/5038&#xD;&#xA;* [Do we want CSTheory.SE to migrate bad questions over here?](https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/q/691/755)" />

I almost agree, but not completely, because it seems like a plausible possibility that questions like this can lead to interesting answers in the theoretical computer science.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not sure if I want to see more questions of this kind or not.  On the one hand, it is interesting to see connections of theoretical computer science to various fields of computer science, and encouraging this kind of questions increases the chance of seeing such connections.  On the other hand, if 20% of the questions on the top page are like this and few of them get answers interesting to me (and worse yet, they are bumped by [community ♦](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/-1/community) from time to time), I am sure that I will get sick of those questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_Added_: Another example of the how-to-model-this questions is “[Finding islands of vertices in a network of roads containing one-way streets](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2227/finding-islands-of-vertices-in-a-network-of-roads-containing-one-way-streets-clo)” by shindigo.

Use an answer to discuss a particular aspect of the article. I understand that issues will overlap, but it's easier to track answers than have one giant comment thread below this question&#xD;&#xA; 2. Make sure you use your real name when editing. We can use revision history to determine who changed what. &#xD;&#xA; 3. I think it's also fair to assume that simple edits (syntax, spelling) are not at the contribution level that might merit &quot;with contributions from&quot;, so try to focus on content edits, and we can all chip in to fix minor issues. &#xD;&#xA; 4.

Active participants range from advanced undergraduates to well-established scientists. Currently the majority of participants are graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, but the number of senior researchers active within the site is growing quickly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though [cs.theory.stackexchange.com](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/) is only two months old, it can already boast of 2,000 registered users, 700 answered questions, and -- perhaps most exciting -- [new research collaborations among computer scientists](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2328/when-should-you-say-what-you-know/2362#2362) who otherwise might never have realized that they were working on related problems.  The atmosphere of the site is a bit like a corridor discussion at a conference: researchers discuss and explain both folklore and the newest results, in a format that can be read at leisure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some questions and their answers are highly technical, but the answers from experts are often more than just answers; they contain insights that are not available in papers or textbooks.  For example, a student who requested a &quot;common sense&quot; explanation for how padding arguments related to complexity class separations received [an intuitive answer from Russell Impagliazzo](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2434/why-do-complexity-classes-translate-upwards-and-not-downwards/2453#2453); Scott Aaronson summarized the [state-of-the-art in non-relativizing techniques][6]; Jeff Erickson explained why [the real RAM model is preferred in computational geometry][7]; and a student who asked whether the Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom number generator relativizes received [an answer from Noam Nisan](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2236/does-nisans-pseudo-random-generator-relativize/2239#2239).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions have also generated new proofs: Peter Shor gave a [reduction from Max-Cut with positive weights to a constant-factor approximation for the version of the problem with negative weights][8]; Jukka Suomela demonstrated that [DOMINATING SET remains NP-complete for planar bipartite graphs of maximum degree 3][9]; Sariel Har-Peled showed that [Hamiltonicity is NP-complete for k-regular graphs for any fixed k][10]; and Per Vognsen outlined a [proof for the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma using projective geometry][11].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to specific technical questions, participants have asked for more general advice from the community, such as [how to referee papers][12], possible [Master's thesis topics in automata theory](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/979/automata-theory-formal-language-thesis-topic), pointers to [recent purely functional data structures][13], suggestions for an [inspirational talk about theoretical computer science][14], and [how to find a job](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2215/how-to-get-a-job).  The site is a place for the larger theory community to come together.

We encourage participation using real names -- and almost everybody does this -- but it's not required.  Participation costs nothing, and takes as little or as much time as you choose. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Site Origin and Structure###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of the founding members of [cstheory.stackexchange.com](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/) participated in discussion of a proposed solution to the P/NP problem that spanned multiple blogs, led to the creation of wiki pages, and brought together researchers in disparate fields from around the world.  This effort made it clear that the worldwide theoretical computer science community was ready for -- and needed -- a structured way to ask research-level questions and to consider answers to such questions.  The success of MathOverflow.net (a site devoted to research-level mathematics) encouraged us to adopt the StackExchange software developed by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. This software provides a user reputation system built on up- and down-voting of contributions to highlight and encourage high quality, and to control spam.  There is also a [&quot;Meta&quot; area][15], for discussions about site scope and direction. Thus far, the system has worked extremely well and we are very pleased with it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Who runs the site?###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You do ! The site is moderated by the community, with users gaining access to more management tools as they gain more reputation within the site. We have an active core of users who diligently monitor the site, help improve the quality of questions and answers, and filter out spam. In fact, this very article is a product of community participation on the site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But you don't have to worry about any of that to contribute to the numerous research discussions taking place right now.

We welcome _research-level_ questions in _theoretical computer science_ (TCS).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although there is no black-and-white distinction between research-level questions and non-research-level questions, questions are considered to be &quot;research-level&quot; roughly when they can be discussed between two professors or between two graduate students working on Ph.D.'s, but not usually between a professor and a typical undergraduate student. It does not include questions at the level of difficulty of typical undergraduate course/textbook homework/exercise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For an explanation of what TCS is, we refer you to the description of ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra.  **Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##My question is not a research-level question in TCS, where can I ask it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For questions other than research-level questions in TCS, you may want to consider the following places to ask:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * General Computer Science — [Computer Science - Stack Exchange](http://cs.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * General Mathematics (including *theoretical* CS) — [Mathematics - Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Research-level Mathematics — [Math Overflow](http://mathoverflow.net/)&#xD;&#xA; * Social and Professional Academic Issues — [Academia - Stack Exchange](http://academia.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Programming — [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * General Artificial Intelligence — [Meta Optimize](http://metaoptimize.com/qa/)&#xD;&#xA; * Statistics and Data Mining — [Cross Validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Applied Cryptography and Security — [Crypto - Stack Exchange](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Computation used in Science and Engineering — [Computational Science - Stack Exchange](http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Questions about this site — [Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange - Meta][1]&#xD;&#xA; * Other — check the list of sites on [Stack Exchange Network](http://stackexchange.com/sites)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Questions should be based on knowledge sharing, not on shirking&#xD;&#xA;You should only post questions you're actually seriously thinking about.

The scope of cstheory is research-level. Questions that are at the level of difficulty of typical undergraduate students are not part of the scope. There are other Q&amp;A sites which have a more general scope like [Math.SE][1] that would welcome questions from students.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Votes (down and up) are one of the main ways users express their opinion about the quality of a question and how interesting it is. A user may down vote a question if she/he thinks the question is off-topic or has other problems (e.g. unclear, not answerable in its current form, argumentative, not a real question, post to solicit opinion, ...).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;If you want to know why [your question](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/8826/is-halting-that-hard-yes) is down voted you can ask for that in place of attacking other users. I will explain my down vote in more detail below:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems to me that you are trying to find a way to get around the undecidability of halting problem. The halting problem (as it is defined in the literature) is undecidable and that is a mathematical theorem. Now one might be interested in decidable variations of halting problem. That is a well studied topic, and one can ask a research level question about that. There are also researchers working on these kind of problems who try to find ways to deal with undecidability in practice (mainly in formal methods community, but also in theoretical computer science). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand your question has no sign that you are familiar with the literature. I can tell that this is something a typical undergraduate student taking their first course in computability would ask. It is nice that a student would think about this kind of problems. But everything has a place and the place of this question is not cstheory. If you ask it on Math.SE you probably will not get any down votes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As an analogy, it is completely fine and even encouraged that students ask questions like this in an undergraduate computability class from the instructor. Asking it in a research-level computability workshop will probably be unwelcome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ask a question about halting problem and show that you are familiar with the literature and understand the basics in the area, and the question is a real question (posting a question to see how others think about your idea about how to solve halting problem is not a real question) and is clearly stated (can be answered without much back-and-forth comments where others try to guess what you want to ask, which can be a sign that the question is not well-thought), then that can be on-topic and I would guess would not receive any down votes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ps:&#xD;&#xA;I would suggest that you take a look at the [this section of the FAQ](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq#questions-should-be-based-on-knowledge-sharing-not-on-shirking) and also the pages linked there. Following those suggestions would increase the chance that your questions are well perceived by the community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://math.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq" />

Scott Aaronson in his blog sometimes uses the scenario of super-intelligent alien beings having a discussion with us to emphasise the universality of certain notions in mathematics or computer science. This post felt like a very scaled-down but realistic form of that thought experiment. A person from a different, but closely related field comes to us and says, &quot;we do logic, you do logic, and we have all these cool results, but what do you have to show for your logic.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; It is difficult to tell from the wording how deep the author's knowledge of classical mathematical logic is, but the question does request for answers that appeal to advanced logical concepts. I was absolutely gung-ho about writing an answer because questions that specifically want and advanced-level survey are rare. A couple of hours later, I realised that this was never going to end. I'm glad to see that the question has now been made community wiki. I think my current answer is too long and should be split into different answers. I have three concrete proposals for answers to that question. Please let me know if you agree with these proposals.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Proposal 1*. Every answer discusses a specific sub-area of computational logic and consists of three paragraphs. The first paragraph give a high-level overview of the field aimed at researchers in mathematics or TCS. The second paragraph highlights some results in the field and techniques used to prove those results. The third paragraph mentions current directions and open problems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Proposal 2*. We make a &quot;table of contents&quot; answer that lists different sub-areas of computational logic and hyperlinks to the different answers. Anyone can add to this list, and then add a separate answer for the area mentioned.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Proposal 3.* If the OP agrees, we modify the original question a bit to make explicit the structure desired for answers. (We could also do this in the ToC answer I suggest in Proposal 2, but people might not read other answers before replying.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I feel such an advanced research summary would be a valuable resource for the future reference, and that obtaining such a survey via our user base would be effective.

But I think people have been too quick to label some questions as &quot;too elementary&quot;, when in fact they describe very real research-level questions.  For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [How are lower bounds for computational complexity proved?](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18372/111)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [Roots of a polynomial](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18406/111)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In both cases, there is an undergraduate-level &quot;textbook&quot; answer.  (For the first question: Sorting requires $\Omega(n\log n)$ comparisons.  For the second question: Hilbert's 10th is undecidable.)  But if we look past those easy answers, these are legitimate research-level questions in theoretical computer science.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Okay, but then how does one prove lower bounds for problems that can't be solved by comparison trees?  Or lower bounds bigger than $\Omega(n\log n)$ for problems solvable in polynomial time?  Or exponential lower bounds for NP-hard problems?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Okay, but then how does one actually find integer roots of polynomials in practice?  Are there effective algorithms for broad and interesting classes of polynomials?  Are there algorithms with provable approximation guarantees (for interesting classes of polynomials)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In both cases, the deeper question is likely not what the original poster intended.  (But StackExchange answers are for the entire community, not just for the original poster.  And why should we shy away from blowing the original poster's mind?)  And even if it were, the posts would require significant editing to bring the deeper question to the fore.

We have discussed previously (see [this](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1264/) and [this](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1395/)) that we are not going to require or even demand people to explain their votes. When I see a down-vote that I don't understand I politely comment that I don't understand it, but I think demanding an explanation or stating that there is no reason for the down-vote goes too far. It is not an abuse if people are using their votes in a way different from us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have argued a number of times that I am against counter-voting, that is voting to null the effect of another user's vote. Everyone has their own opinion. The total reflects the opinion of the community, it is not the job of any particular user to decide what the total should be. Counter-voting encourages other users to do the same and use their votes to null votes in place of express their opinion about the question. Each vote is a manifestation of some user's opinion and if we respect their opinions then we should respect their votes even when we disagree with them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it is more productive if we comment and explain why we think it is a suitable and interesting question in place of just asking others why they have down-voted the post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this particular case, I see several possible reasons for a down-vote. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Formating: It is using an image in place of writing the expression which I think has been one of the reasons people down-vote. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Content: The questions seems to simply ask how to calculate some expression for some particular values. It seems to ask how to apply a method explained in a paper in a particular case in practice. It is too localized and it doesn't seem to be a _research-level_ question in _theoretical_ computer science. It is also unclear what is the trouble the OP is facing in calculating the expression.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you ask me I think we are being too open right now (I guess it is partly because people get bored that there are not as many questions as they would like) to questions which should not be here and are more suitable for CS.SE.

And [this](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/18903/how-would-the-use-of-ternary-computers-change-complexity-of-algorithms) is clearly not-research level in my opinion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools?tab=close&amp;daterange=last30days" />

I would also like to see a place where such questions are answered with pointers to non-obvious papers, snippets told by colleagues, historical background that isn't published, and insights that may be common in some parts of the community but which are not universally known.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other words: I am adept at using a search engine.

While I try to judge this proposal on its own merit, it is likely that the time and energy I have invested in CS.SE influences me.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm afraid that broadening the scope in this way would destroy the existing community. A Stack Exchange site is defined by two things: the kind of questions it accepts, and the audience it attracts. Even though each question is in principle judged on its intrinsic merits, the long-term effect is to create a community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On this site, the community is centered around researchers in theoretical computer science. Participants tend to be researchers in TCS, researchers in other fields, or graduate students aspiring to become researchers. The participants who are welcomed are generally those who came with the expectation of participating in a community dominated by TCS researchers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do not see a problem with allowing more applied questions. As long as academics and people who want to fit in with academics dominate the site, that isn't a problem. It may be difficult to bootstrap an applied CS community (it would have been a lot easier to do when the site was young), but if it works, it won't change the tone of the site, and if it fails, the site won't have changed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, opening the door to more basic questions means opening the door to a broader audience. This should be a carefully controlled process. In particular, I advise you not to try to draw on Stack Overflow as an audience base. A majority of Stack Overflow does not know or care what it means to be a scientist. The kind of people you would attract are those who now post on [Programmers](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/). If you attract those people, be prepared to moderate their content. And to moderate them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Reacting to specific points in your proposal:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We now have a natural forum (cs.stackexchange.com) for the more &quot;basic&quot; algorithms questions, and the cstheory &quot;brand&quot; is well established as a 'research-only' venue. So we have an easy process to shunt questions that are obviously undergrad level.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind that CS.SE is not exclusively for basic questions. It is for questions at all level, ranging all the way from CS 101 homework to applied research (and even research in theory, but we suggest CSTheory.SE to the rare asker who comes with a theory question that seems to go unanswered because it is too hard).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; excluding questions from people who might be 'research-level' in a sub area but aren't experts in some other domain&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From what I see (I admit to not following CSTheory.SE very closely), this already happens: as long as there's a feeling that peers are talking with peers, questions tend to be appreciated, left open and answered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; creating the impression of an unfriendly site (which is a bigger problem in terms of maintaining the audience)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the community is doing an adequate job of retaining the audience it likes in and keeping the undesirables in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All in all, while the current guidelines may be stricter than this, I think an intelligent application of the existing policies already gives you what you want.&#xD;&#xA;" />

[golden age](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2013/2/160156-the-explosive-growth-of-postdocs-in-computer-science/fulltext), and thats motivating, energizing, even at times [exciting](http://vzn1.wordpress.com/2014/01/17/dwave-and-the-inception-of-the-qm-computing-dream/). its a field-in-motion. cutting edge and an awesome, buzzing-crackling fusion of abstract theory and real-life application. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;so, a dream job for me would be high-paying TCS research/applications and have come close to that fantasy in real life over the years. but, later, after working 4 yrs in scientific laboratory alongside graduate students and Phds, realized that combination of terms might be verging mostly on an oxymoron; ie it seemed that scientific researchers (not just those in TCS) didnt seem to be (how to put this delicately) reknowned for their salaries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;am proud to be a contributing part of a rare, unique group that captures some of this energy/momentum/dynamism esp in the way that it [connects with applications](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/19759/core-algorithms-deployed). &#xD;&#xA;([tag:application-of-theory] is my favorite conceptual fusion/paradigm/site tag.) by some very hard work by many dedicated, farsighted, brilliant individuals, cstheory stackexchange is a really superb forum and by far the best venue on the entire cyberspace for that right now, and probably will be for years into the future. it mixes top achievers from academia with the wild open internet (another great/shearing _fusion_).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;TCS is also in the midst and at the forefront of massive/pivotal decade-long shifts and transformations. eg quantum computing, [electronic publishing/open science](http://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Discovery-The-Networked-Science/dp/0691148902/), [collaborative filtering, collective wisdom, collective intelligence](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/4768/references-on-collective-intelligence-with-respect-to-cs-applications) and amazingly the stackexchange site captures various key elements of all that.&#xD;&#xA;am especially interested in &#xD;&#xA;[cyber collaboration](http://vzn1.wordpress.com/volunteer/) possibilities seen in the groundbreaking [polymath](http://polymathprojects.org/) model, which is at heart in its radical/dramatic successes not that different than the [stackexchange system](http://www.simonsfoundation.org/mathematics-and-physical-science/the-global-math-commons/).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;what is [great] TCS? how about simply listing my idiosyncratic personal TCS inspirations/influences/luminary/hero pantheon off the top of my head: [Lipton](http://www.scs.gatech.edu/features/career-solution), [Fortnow](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/features/fortnow), [Jukna](http://www.amazon.com/Boolean-Function-Complexity-Algorithms-Combinatorics/dp/3642245072), [Razborov](http://www.mathunion.org/general/prizes/nevanlinna/prize-winners/o/General/Prizes/Nevanlinna/1990/Razborov/page1.html), [Aaronson](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/), [Feynman](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02650179), [Shor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor's_algorithm), Sedgewick, Knuth, [Cook](http://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/pvsnp.pdf), [Turing](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/11797/alan-turings-contributions-to-computer-science), [Mandelbrot](http://nautil.us/issue/0/the-story-of-nautilus/in-the-mind-of-the-fractal-king), [Hofstadter](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/18968/what-are-the-popular-science-books-that-inspire-tcs), [Wolfram](http://www.wolframscience.com/). etc!

Cool!  It seems like it would be a good experiment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The tricky bit is to select the criteria for which questions would be shown.  I can see two plausible possibilities:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Alternative 1: Have a set of tags which are eligible for this, e.g., algorithms, complexity-theory, computability, undecidability, etc.  Any question with vote total of 10+ and with at least one tag in the whitelist would then be eligible to be shown on CSTheory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; This might whittle down the list of questions to those that are related to theoretical computer science.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; However, it has the problem that many of the questions selected in this way will not be research-level.  There are a lot of questions on CS.SE with 10+ votes that are not research-level questions in theoretical computer science, and they might be unwelcome on CSTheory.  Take a look at the [top questions on CS.SE](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes) sorted by vote total, or the [top questions on CS.SE with the complexity-theory tag](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/complexity-theory?sort=votes&amp;pageSize=50) and you'll see what I mean.  Only a small fraction of the highest-voted questions there would be a good fit for CSTheory; the majority would not be useful to display on CSTheory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; I looked at the top 50 highest-voted questions on CS.SE with the complexity-theory tag.  All of them have a vote total of 10 or higher.  By my own highly personal assessment, about 10 of them look like they would be good to display on the CSTheory.SE front page.  The others don't look like great candidates (they are elementary, of narrow interest, or were about proving NP-hardness of a specific problem and the question has already been solved).  A 20% hit rate isn't great.  But this is my own personal taste, and others may differ.  I encourage readers to do their own count, see what they get, and post their own evaluation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Alternative 2: Allow moderators to select which questions are eligible for display in this way.  This could be indicated, for instance, via a moderator-only tag that's added to the question on CS.SE, which triggers it to be shown on CSTheory -- analogous to the &quot;featured&quot; tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; This would require some manual effort from moderators, but allows more control over which questions are displayed, and enables selecting questions which are research-level and which relate to theoretical computer science.  (A minor difficulty with using a special tag is that, if the question already has 5 tags, it may not be possible to add a 6th tag.)&#xD;&#xA;" />

Your question might be suitable for [Computer Science](https://cs.stackexchange.com/) which has a broader scope.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While it might be technically correct, this reason is very misleading, particularly for those not familiar with theoretical computer science _such as the posters of those questions_, because the bold part strongly suggests that the problem with the question is that it is not at the research level, whereas the real problem is that it is not a question in or about theoretical computer science.  (Moreover, the question might even be a research question in the field which it belongs to.)  If you are curious, [the message quoted above was proposed to be used when a question was not research-level](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2700), so it is an abuse of this reason by all means in my opinion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you choose “off-topic” as the reason, you have an option to enter your custom reason instead of choosing one of the canned responses.  Please use it instead.  Unfortunately, a custom reason works differently from canned responses in that the custom reason is posted as a comment at the time you cast a vote, and I can imagine some circumstances in which you do not want to do this.

It seems that most people disagree, and I started to feel that it is a waste of time to try to convince people otherwise.  For now, I still hesitate to vote for off topic (or to be listed as one of the people who closed the question as off topic) when I see too elementary a question, so probably I will not vote to close it.  Hopefully there are enough people to close it anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When we vote to close a question, we choose the reason from several choices.  It seems that if a question is too elementary, it is often closed for the reason “off topic.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I understand that this choice of reason is based on the consensus about the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  However, if a question is closed for the reason “off topic,” the following explanation is added to the question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; closed as off topic by [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone], [Someone] [Date]&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Questions on Theoretical Computer Science are expected to generally relate to Theoretical Computer Science, within the scope defined in the [faq](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have trouble even parsing this sentence because of the tentative name of the website, but more importantly this does not mention the expected level of questions on cstheory.stackexchange.com.  It plainly states that the question is not related to the theoretical computer science, which is often false.  This gives the false impression that we take the theoretical computer science very narrowly.  I think that this is problematic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(_Added in revision 5_: The link in the explanation quoted above links to the [built-in FAQ](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq), not to the [FAQ on Meta](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science).  The built-in FAQ is not clear about the expected level of questions, either, except that the sentence “Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields” may suggest that research-level questions are expected.  A clearer statement can be reached by the following chain of links: the explanation of “off topic” → [built-in FAQ](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq) → [FAQ on Meta](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science) → [What kind of questions are too basic?](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235)  But I doubt that users can find this path unless they are already familiar with the website.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What should we do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are a few suggestions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. If the consensus is really that cstheory.stackexchange.com is for questions of at least certain level, the explanation of the reason “off topic” should be rewritten to reflect it.  Is this possible?&#xD;&#xA;2. &lt;del&gt;On [MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/), too elementary questions are often closed for the reason “too localized.”  Obviously this is an abuse and [it certainly confuses some users](https://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/274/what-does-too-localized-mean-exactly/), but it is possible to interpret it as “This question is so elementary that it is useful only for the asker,” and it is understandable (or at least less prone to misunderstanding).  How about adopting this convention, at least until the explanation of “off topic” is modified to a better description?&lt;/del&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Related:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- See a [related FAQ entry](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235) and the links given there for discussions about what we mean by “too elementary.”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;_Added in revision 4:_ Whereas the description of the close reason is not shown on the question page on MathOverflow, it is shown on cstheory.stackexchange.com, which may make abusing harder.  Here is the description of the close reason “too localized”:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This question would only be relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The point of the suggestion 2 above is that it is at least possible to argue that too elementary questions fall into the third group (and possibly also the second group) of this description.&#xD;&#xA;" />

For specific questions more pertinent to this particular site, please visit the **[Official Theoretical Computer Science FAQ](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science)**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this is not bad as a starting point, there are several shortcomings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* As is often pointed out, it only mentions what theoretical computer science is and that it does not mention the expected level of questions.&#xD;&#xA;* Related to the first item, a list of alternative sites to ask questions is desirable.  The scope of our website is often better communicated by such a list.&#xD;&#xA;* The quotation is unclear about where it is quoted from.  In fact, it is originally quoted from the self-description of ACM SIGACT but it seems that SIGACT has modified this description after the text was copied, so it is kind of obsolete.  For example, the current list includes computational economics and omits the reference to VLSI, both of which are understandable.&#xD;&#xA;* I cannot see the point of emphasizing only the last sentence in the quotation from SIGACT.&#xD;&#xA;* The distinction between “general FAQs” and “official theoretical computer science FAQ” is confusing at best and makes no sense at worst.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest to revise the above text to the following.  [https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/](https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/) is written very well, and I stole part of the general structure from it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange** is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields.  We welcome _research-level_ questions in _theoretical computer science_ (TCS).&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Although there is no black-and-white distinction between research-level questions and non-research-level questions, questions are considered to be “research-level” roughly when they can be discussed between two professors or between two graduate students working on Ph.D.’s, but not usually between a professor and a typical undergraduate student.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For questions other than research-level questions in TCS, you may want to consider the following places to ask:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * Research-level mathematics — [Math Overflow](https://mathoverflow.net/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * Programming — [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * General mathematics — [Mathematics - Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/); they seem to accept also questions in TCS.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For an explanation of what TCS is, we refer you to the description of ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT):&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra.

Those are people that make all kinds of simulations, like computational physicists, computational chemists, computational biologists, computational sociologists, ..., meteorologists, economists, visual/physical effect makers, various kinds of engineers; people processing data, like various data scientists, bioinformaticians, chemoinformaticians, again economists, machine teachers, text miners, image and sound wizards and the rest of data-AI; finally all soft computing, robotics and steering theory debris.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is some overlap between the two, mostly in areas of numerics, BLAS and some &quot;golden&quot; algorithms like Smith-Waterman (C-nal Scientists spent thousands of CPU hours in such so they would use any fast working black-box C-ter Scientists would gave them).

Interdisciplinary fields make the problem worse. For instance, someone who works in (theoretical, not applied) cryptography must have a good knowledge of the computational complexity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What happens when you need to ask a question which, while related to your research topic, happens to be lie within another field? Well, a complicated problem for you might be too basic for researches in the target field.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I like the model of Math.SE / MathOverflow a lot: If I think my question is too basic (which usually is!), I'll ask it on Math.SE.

For instance, if I ever knew that they exist, I'd join them at once.

In my opinion, that is plain wrong. A basic question about Turing machines is a simple counterexample.&#xD;&#xA;* The latter group were unable to distinguish between research-level questions and basic ones.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some discussions can be found here: [Is Computer Science a duplicate of Theoretical Computer Science](https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/q/682/22946).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In an extreme case, Jonik suggested: &quot;Instead of another site, how about modifying the description of the existing site to allow a little less advanced CS theory questions too.&quot; His suggestion was unwelcome, and received some down-votes. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In another thread, &#xD;&#xA;Joel Spolsky [requested](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/947/873) that we (TCS.SE) broaden our view.

I ask people here to help (re)create one on Area51, and support it adequately.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;PS: There's always an issue of homeworks: Professors don't like their students to *cheat* by asking homework problems in online forums.

Should back-and-forth discussion in the comments be deleted, moved to chat, or retained?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;5.

Thank you to Bjørn Kjos-Hanssen for having stood up as a candidate in this session. However, as [explained previously](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2989/2017-moderator-election-we-need-more-candidates), in order for an election to proceed to voting phases it is required that there is at least one more candidate than there are spaces remaining in the election. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is important for a variety of reasons. The first is that it allows the election process to proceed in a way that allows candidates to be evaluated before being elected. It also serves to indicate that there are enough people in the community who are willing to handle the responsibilities of overseeing moderation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Theoretical Computer Science is not a site that's particularly in danger of low moderation. There's a healthy number of regular users across most reputation brackets who remain active on the site, still handling general moderation tasks.  The flag load itself isn't particularly large, and the current moderation team has expressed that they aren't overwhelmed by it. However, only one of the current moderators is highly active - while this is sufficient for the current flag load, it is healthier for the site to have multiple active moderators, not only to split even the small loads but also to handle situations where one of the moderators may have more pressing matters to attend.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It could be that now is just not a good time to have hosted an election for this site. The winter holidays are coming up soon, as well, which will mess up with future election timings, so we'll most likely look at some elections coming into the new year. " />

Why do you want to be a moderator for the cstheory stackexchange community?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd like to gain a deeper understanding of (a) theoretical computer science and (b) the StackExchange system of sites. Also it seems like it should be fairly easy to do a reasonable job. I have [&gt;15K rep on MathOverflow][1] so am pretty familiar with SE sites. I like how SE sites make micro-publishing into a kind of game, and I developed a couple of TCS-related games:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Gamify your Q&amp;A][2]][3]&#xD;&#xA;[![Gamify your Q&amp;A][4]][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have some [papers][6] on computability theory and theoretical computer science (automata theory) but looking to learn more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;2. When a comment is flagged as 'no longer needed', what criteria will you use to determine whether to keep the comment or to delete it? Do you lean towards keeping all comments as a record of what has transpired? Do you learn towards deleting old comments that are no longer making a major contribution? What approach will you take?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are some easy cases: if a comment is just pointing out a mistake and that has already been fixed, then the comment is probably no longer needed. Also, if a comment no longer makes sense because related comments have already been deleted, it should make sense to delete. Moreover, if someone goes out of their way and flags a comment like &quot;Thanks!&quot; as no longer needed, I'd tend to go along with that. On the other hand, comments are often substantial and should be kept.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;3. I have a bit the impression that part of the reason why the &quot;inactivity&quot; of the moderators came to the attention of SE was the question https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/38803/is-norbert-blums-2017-proof-that-p-ne-np-correct which attracted some inappropriate content and corresponding flags. Those flags stayed around for a long time before they were handled. But apart from that episode, I never had the impression that cstheory.se would need more active moderators, the community self-moderation felt sufficient. Should moderators stay inactive as long as the self-moderation of the community works well?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually, I hope so, as I have only so much time to spend! :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In any case, SE has an official document about this -- [A Theory of Moderation][7].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;4. How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The user should receive some friendly hints that they are being problematic. If that doesn't help I would discuss with other moderators and then there is the possibility of a temporary suspension.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;5. How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;f it seemed very unreasonable to me I would probably discuss it with the other moderator; if only borderline I'd just let it go.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;6. In your opinion, what do moderators do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Deal with flags (by the way I have a [100% helpful flag record on MathOverflow][8]) and some other things discussed in [A Theory of Moderation][7]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;7. A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That seems okay, what I write here tends to be very neutral and polite, as I am aware that each comment is a nano-publication of sorts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;8. In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't feel that it would &quot;make me more effective&quot; but it could be an interesting way to contribute to the site and stay involved.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://mathoverflow.net/users/4600/bj%C3%B8rn-kjos-hanssen&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.imgur.com/8lfJTut.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://math.hawaii.edu/wordpress/bjoern/software/web/complexity-guessing-game/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://i.imgur.com/1YMWwSJ.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://math.hawaii.edu/wordpress/bjoern/software/web/complexity-option-game/&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://math.hawaii.edu/wordpress/bjoern/papers/&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/05/18/a-theory-of-moderation/&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: https://mathoverflow.net/users/flag-summary/4600" />

I have an interest in many computer science topics, but I rarely read computer science publications, have never browsed arVix, and really don't want to learn how to use such a system that I'll never use off of this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I routinely read other publications of papers by the IEEE (in fact, I have the most recent issue of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering next to me right now). Papers in this publication have &quot;index terms&quot; - keywords that describe what the paper is about. I grabbed a copy of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology out of my shelf, and they have three sections: categories and subject descriptions (which contain a code as well as textual descriptions), general terms, and additional key words/phrases. Whenever I've searched for papers in an online database, my matches have always come from the keywords sections or the body of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at these tags, they are unwieldy. I have no idea what the tag means, and I wouldn't expect that most undergraduate computer scientists and software engineers would either. Given the responses to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/115&quot;&gt;my previous question here on Meta&lt;/a&gt;, you want to be inclusive of multiple skill levels. If I find it difficult to search and browse through questions based on tags (which are also used in the site search engine), I'll be less likely to use this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of following MathOverflow, I believe that this exchange should follow a path closer to that of &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/48/should-mathoverflow-tag-prefixes-be-used&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186/setting-things-straight-what-style-of-tags-are-we-going-to-be-using-when-we-laun&quot;&gt;relevant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59/mathoverflow-tags-others&quot;&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt; on their Meta that I could find. The Mathematics community appears to be doing quite well in terms of having people of various skill levels (appears to range from undergraduate university-level mathematics on up), their tagging appears to be working quite well, and I honestly find it easier to read and search than MathOverflow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But really, if this Stack Exchange follows MathOverflow, I actually see someone else coming along and making another Computer Science exchange geared toward a broader audience, in terms of skill levels. I think that this exchange can avoid this splintering of the community (avoiding another Unix/Linux versus Ubuntu Stack Exchange problem) by catering to as many people of various skill levels and educational backgrounds as possible. Yes, you need a specific focus on certain topics and clearly define what is and is not on-topic, but you want to segregate based on those topics, not by knowledge or experience. By dumping the arVix style tags, you make it easy for everyone to find questions/answers, but also make the site friendlier to less knowledgeable and experienced people such as myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, that's not to say that arVix isn't useful. I believe Stack Exchanges have the &quot;tag wiki&quot; page that Stack Overflow has. It would be benefitial to identify which tags correspond to arVix topic areas and link to those topic areas in the tag wiki for a given tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, a technical consideration: The &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;tags are specified using rel=&quot;tag&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in the source of a page. If you aren't familiar with microformats, search engines actually do pick up on them and they do help people find pages. People who do searches search for things like &quot;data structure&quot; and &quot;data structures&quot;, not &quot;cs.DS.data-structures&quot;. The tags should reflect what people are searching on Google and Bing so that they are brought to questions on Stack Exchanges that are relevant to their searches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also want to address a few comments and other postings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another point that I've read in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/74#74&quot;&gt;some postings and comments here&lt;/a&gt; is that you want to maintain compatibility with MathOverflow. I think this is a mistake. MathOverflow is a Stack Exchange 1.0 site and, last I heard, had no intention of migrating to Stack Exchange 2.0. However, there are a number of Stack Exchange 2.0 sites that might be of interest to this community in some way that are at various levels of existance - Stack Overflow (people might ask algorithm or data structure implementation questions here), Mathematics (which includes discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorics...), Statistical Analysis (which includes machine learning), Not Programming Related, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Application Security, Machine Learning, Numerical Modeling and Simulation, Signal Processing, Operating systems Development, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, and Cryptography (and those are just the first 10 pages of proposals, sorted by progress). These are the communities that need to work together to decide what best belongs where, especially since it appears that there will be a feature to move questions between various Stack Exchange 2.0 sites. Unless things change on MathOverflow, you will never be able to migrate a question from here to MO. However, in the future, it will be possible to migrate questions to the exchanges I mentioned, and so far, none of them are using ArVix tagging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/42#42&quot;&gt;first mentioned in a comment here&lt;/a&gt;, some of the ArVix tags are long. Potentially too long to fit in the limit of a tag. The purpose of tags is to help people search and sort through questions. If you start abbreviating ArVix tags, you open up a whole new can of worms with the best way to abbreviate the tags.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="403" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:19:18.947" LastActivityDate="2010-08-25T22:09:30.680" CommentCount="9" />

It involves requiring certain tags on the main site (similar to how tags such as &quot;discussion&quot; are required on Meta).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The categories that compose Computer Science on ArXiv that appear to be within scope of TCS are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;artificial-intelligence&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;complexity&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;computational-geometry&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;game-theory&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;vision&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;security (instead of just cryptography, to include stenography without a long tag - and I would love to see some stego questions here.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;data-structures&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;algorithms&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;databases&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;discrete mathematics (this is probably off-topic and should be on Mathematics?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;distributed-computing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;parallel-computing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cluster-computing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;formal-languages / automata-theory (need to clean this up somehow, perhaps even splitting them into two tags, such as how I split data-structures and algorithms into two tags, even though they are a single ArXiv topic area)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;graphics&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;information-retrieval&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;information-theory&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;multiagent-systems&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;performance&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;programming-languages&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;evolutionary-computing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that a few off-topic ones probably slipped through. But the point is, these are the topic areas within ArXiv that are relevant to this site. Simply make it so that one or more of these tags is required. Drop the entire beginning portion and only go with the plain-English name. On the tag wiki for each one, provide the full ArXiv name (cs.XX.whatever) and link to the page for each one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that some have been broken up. &quot;data-structures&quot; and &quot;algorithms&quot; are separate tags, even though there is one arXiv section for both. I think they are separate enough to warrant being broken up here, but the tag wiki page for each would link to the same section or the ArXiv site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this actually makes everyone happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) We are using standardized names presented in ArXiv that have well-defined meanings. This is good for categorizing content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) The tags are in plain English, which will mean that people searching using the built-in search as well as coming from Google will see only the portion of the tag that is relevant to their query.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(3) The tags are short, simple, and beginner-friendly. I'm not an expert on any of these topics, but I can clearly define what most, if not all, of these areas encompass. I look at &quot;cc.complexity-theory&quot; and know what &quot;complexity-theory&quot; means, but I have no clue of the significance of &quot;cc&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(4) We can be better assured that every question posted to TCS is actually on-topic. If it doesn't fall into one of the knowledge areas that is required, then the question is off-topic and belongs somewhere else. For example, if we didn't put discrete-mathematics on the required list, someone would have to take a look and try to attach another tag to it. Either they would succeed and it would be good or they wouldn't and then wouldn't be able to post it here without making up a tag. Even so, however, there might be subtopics within each of these areas that is off-topic, so that would need to be worked out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To address some of the comments:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For filtering purposes. If you just take the top-level tags and mark some of them as &quot;interesting&quot; and some &quot;ignored&quot;, you'll immediately have a very effective filter. If we have the policy that each question is tagged with at least one &quot;top level tag&quot;, your filter should work pretty well. On the other hand, if we just have a large collection of tags that people can use and create however they want, maintaining your filter and keeping it effective (and spotting false positives/negatives) becomes a burden.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think it matters if you have top-level tags for filtering. It's good to have very specific, well-defined tags that mean something specific and where many people know their meaning. Having ambiguous words/phrases/keywords as tags would be a problem, but it doesn't matter what the tag is as long as anyone can look at it and tell what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of the use of any tags - I would like to first point out Stack Overflow, Super User, and Server Fault. They allow for random tags, yet the users are able to find and filter based on their preferences. It all boils down to the fact that in a folksonomy, the tags and their meanings will eventually converge. You might be interested in reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1242572.1242602&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Complex Dynamics of Collaborative Tagging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january06/guy/01guy.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Folksonomies: Tidying Up Tags?&lt;/a&gt;, and Clay Shirky's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ontology is Overrated&lt;/a&gt;. I can recommend a number of other papers on folksonomies and ontologies if you are interested, but the short story is that tagging needs to be more organic and less structured for it to develop meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And regarding filters: this site only works if people can use it to get good answers from the experts. We should make the life of those who are looking for relevant questions that they could answer as easy as possible. With &quot;top level tags&quot;, you can just mark your own field of expertise as &quot;interesting&quot; and then check cstheory.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=mytags whenever you have time. Or subscribe to the relevant RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using plain English terms from a source would accomplish this as well. It doesn't matter if you use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computer.org/portal/web/publications/acmtaxonomy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IEEE Computer Science Keywords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jucs.org/jucs_info/acm_categories&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ACM Categories&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/corr/subjectclasses&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Computing Research Repository subject areas&lt;/a&gt;. As long as you have a community practice (either community enforced or by requiring at least one tag from a group of tags), people will be able to find things. It doesn't matter what that tag is. However, I personally feel that &quot;complexity-theory&quot; is much easier to manage than &quot;cc.complexity-theory&quot;. It's more familiar to people who don't use/know ArXiv, but it uses the exact same subject name, allowing people who are interested in the ArXiv knowledge area of complexity theory to follow it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I have a long list of 'uninteresting' tags so as to get rid of topics I don't care about. top level tagging helps me focus positively on stuff I do care about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is accomplished with any tagging system, given enough time (see the papers and articles I linked to in response to the first comment). It does help to have tags from Day 1 that are meaningful, see my response to the second comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There's a risk that required tags will be confusing for new users. I'm inclined to 'educate' new users, by retagging their questions, but this wouldn't work well if (i) users would be put off by having tags added, or (ii) the retagging would tend not to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is also a good idea, as long as the full ArXiv tags are not used. Like I've said many times, ArXiv tags are too unwieldy. The simplest, and best community-oriented approach (see any number of research reports on developing folksonomies) would be free tagging. However, that doesn't seem to be of interest to the community here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as retagging goes, if the community doesn't edit posts and tags, then the community is failing and this Stack Exchange probably won't survive. If you aren't editing questions and answers to make them better (at least, where it is possible to make them better), and editing tags to make questions easier to find, then you are missing out on the point of how a Stack Exchange is supposed to work. If you aren't editing questions/answers because you don't want other people to edit your postings, then this isn't someplace you want to be since the system is designed to support the editing of posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="403" LastEditorUserId="403" LastEditDate="2010-08-26T09:49:49.363" LastActivityDate="2010-08-26T09:49:49.363" CommentCount="10" CommunityOwnedDate="2010-08-25T22:36:35.050" />

I'm a software engineer, but I'm dealing with a lot of topics at work that touch on topics here - algorithms and data structures (especially performance), cryptography, stenography, security, as well as concurrent and distributed systems (but these are more from an applied standing rather than the theoretical that is more appropriate here). Even taking a look back at previous jobs, having a Stack Exchange to ask questions and provide answers about computer science topics I've encountered would have been helpful a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If anything is going to be a problem, it's going to be scaring away people who aren't experts in the field. Honestly, I'm not that thrilled with the current state of TCS. It's following MathOverflow too closely and is catering to the experts. What makes Stack Overflow (and even Mathematics and Statistical Analysis) so great is that people of various levels of knowledge and experience are using the exact same site. The problem with MathOverflow (and TCS is going down this road) is that it focuses on the experts and the researchers. TCS does have some college students using it, but many are in a program or that deals exclusively with theoretical CS, and these people appear to be doing OK. However, people like me who have a more practical background, but are interested in the theoretical side of things without a formal education, aren't made to feel as welcome (or at least, that's the impression I get).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think part of the problem is that there is no hands on leadership. This Stack Exchange was proposed by Anand Kulkarni (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/users/71/anand-kulkarni&quot;&gt;meta profile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/71&quot;&gt;site profile&lt;/a&gt;). Yet this user has less than 200 reputation, has only posted 3 things (1 question, 2 answers) on the main site, and has only posted 2 answers on the meta. So right from Day 1, the person who came up with this idea hasn't been involved in the site. Stack Exchange doesn't give you the tools you need to lay the framework for a site until it goes into Private Beta, and by then, it's too late for the person who came up with this idea to propose a framework of how the system works in his/her mind, since other people have already started to use the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the focus on experts/experienced people and lack of hands on leadership (although some people are emerging as leaders, so this might turn around with the addition of moderators), I wouldn't be surprised if this Stack Exchange doesn't make it. And I think that it would be a shame if it didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Are you pleased with the quality and interest of the questions and answers you've seen on the main site?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/585/what-is-the-difference-between-a-second-preimage-attack-and-a-collision-attack&quot;&gt;one question&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm quite pleased with the answer I got. The way I worded my question, I didn't expect someone to take the time to write up such a detailed answer. But they did, and I'm better off because of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How well do you think we are doing at resolving issues and conflicts that arise?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a problem with the Stack Exchange system. The fact that there is no place for meta discussions until the site goes into private beta is a bad thing. So right now, we (and I think several Stack Exchanges have had this problem) have lots of people who read the description of the site, but then got there and were disappointed because the description didn't capture what was really happening. Because of this, everyone comes to Meta after there are already questions and answers posted on the site, time is passing, more questions/answers are being posted, and there's no agreed upon method to do things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it will get better once there are more high reputation users and moderators on the main site, but I do think that this is something that the Stack Exchange team needs to address.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="403" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.560" LastActivityDate="2010-08-26T10:19:34.057" CommentCount="4" />

I'm an undergraduate enrolled in a Computer Science program. I have plans to triple major with Mathematics and I'm looking at enrolling in a graduate school. I have found my undergraduate degree underwhelming - the program at my school focuses very strongly on the engineering aspects of Computer Science I'd learned myself during K-12. I supplement my education at this university with extracurricular learning (personal projects as often as reading papers or introductory material on mathematical topics). CSTheory/TheoryOverflow has been one of my bids to do this outside learning. Namely, I've been trying to answer questions well when I have relevant knowledge (or know where to find the answer) and I read questions that I are beyond my current state of knowledge, adding referenced materials and authors to my queue. I plan on using the site to ask questions about papers as I read them and also to request references for 'cursory' introductions or high level explanations of complicated topics in the field so that I can get intuition regarding concepts undergraduate learning hasn't prepared me for (things like 'sparsity as related to compressive sensing' or 'why Mulmuley GCT appears to be a strong approach').&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Do you have general thoughts about the future of the site?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Are you pleased with the quality and interest of the questions and answers you've seen on the main site?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a few occassions now I have had serious doubts about this stackexchange. Usually these are brought on by specific experiences on the site, be they encounters with a less agreeable person or a severely bad question/answer. To echo what some others have said, I have found the number of CW/big-list questions asked here to be undesirable. Specifically, I think the distribution of questions asked on the stack exchange to be bimodal - many clustered at the &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; end where lots of users can submit answers (sometimes even very subjective or discussion-like answers) with exceptions being those questions that are targeted toward very specific subdomain expertise (and often I have noticed a large number of questions involve asking already widely studied open questions).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would personally prefer a site with a normal distribution - less low hanging fruit and less very, very niche questions (but some of both). The majority of the questions, I think, should be medium-to-hard level research questions that &lt;em&gt;aren't previously asked open questions&lt;/em&gt; and which include a strong statement motivating why the question is interesting and whose resolution or reduction to other well-known questions can serve as expository examples for clever techniques, facts and lemmas in the field. (Of course a good variety of questions are welcome - I myself would plan to ask specific questions about steps in proofs.) To put it more succinctly, I haven't really noticed any original &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; being written here - this is diametrically opposed to MathOverflow. Of course, I think this might be unfair to ask for in the first 10 days of the site. But this is what I imagine the site's goal being.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do hope that this site (or a site like it) succeeds. I found the number of users involved in the site surprisingly large and active (although I have very little experience with stackexchange websites or community forums to compare against). I have found some of the questions and answers on the site interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How well do you think we are doing at resolving issues and conflicts that arise?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the count of high-reputations users is low, I have noticed issues being resolved in what I believe to be a reasonable turn-around time.

It seems that most people disagree, and I started to feel that it is a waste of time to try to convince people otherwise.  For now, I still hesitate to vote for off topic (or to be listed as one of the people who closed the question as off topic) when I see too elementary a question, so probably I will not vote to close it.  Hopefully there are enough people to close it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we vote to close a question, we choose the reason from several choices.

How about adopting this convention, at least until the explanation of “off topic” is modified to a better description?&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235&quot;&gt;related FAQ entry&lt;/a&gt; and the links given there for discussions about what we mean by “too elementary.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added in revision 4:&lt;/em&gt; Whereas the description of the close reason is not shown on the question page on MathOverflow, it is shown on cstheory.stackexchange.com, which may make abusing harder.

After all, it is a question about cooking, not in the theoretical computer science.  But this question is clearly asking for an algorithm.  Although its goal is not to compute any mathematical objects and it is usually called a recipe, these do not mean that it is not an algorithm.  “It cannot be implemented on computers or Turing machines” does not sound like a good reason that it is not an algorithm, either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Well,” you might say, “even if the question is about algorithms, it is too vague for a question in the theoretical computer science.  How do you define ‘pumpkin fries,’ ‘crispy’ and ‘soft’?  Oh, and you speak of the outside and inside.  Do you mean that pumpkin fries lie in a topological space?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, if we think this way, it starts to sound as if we should close it as “not a real question” or “subjective and argumentative,” not as off topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am still pretty sure that the question &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; off topic, but I find it more difficult than I thought to define when a question is about algorithms, especially because I believe that it is correct to say that a cooking recipe is an algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;.

This effort made it clear that the worldwide theoretical computer science community was ready for -- and needed -- a structured way to ask research-level questions and to consider answers to such questions.  The success of MathOverflow.net (a site devoted to research-level mathematics) encouraged us to adopt the StackExchange software developed by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. This software provides a user reputation system built on up- and down-voting of contributions to highlight and encourage high quality, and to control spam.  There is also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;&quot;Meta&quot; area&lt;/a&gt;, for discussions about site scope and direction. Thus far, the system has worked extremely well and we are very pleased with it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Who runs the site?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You do ! The site is moderated by the community, with users gaining access to more management tools as they gain more reputation within the site.

These questions will be asked by someone with only the best intentions at heart, and will be immediately &quot;voted to be closed&quot; and commented upon by moderators, typically in a fashion that might be characterized as abrasive, if not rude.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recognize the importance of keeping the site clean of obvious spam and questions that truly detract from the experience of using the site or the general quality of the content...but do we really need to be so harsh on people who post at least semi-reasonable questions?  Rather than immediately write a comment to the effect of, &quot;This is the worst question I've ever seen, I think it should be closed immediately,&quot; why not work with posters of sub-optimal questions to try to help them improve the quality?

What do you gain, and what might you lose by being so strict/abrasive?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order that this question might not get closed as &quot;not a real question&quot; :), let me ask one:  What is the &lt;em&gt;justification&lt;/em&gt; for the strictness on question closure?  I am not sure that there isn't one, so perhaps I should ask if there isn't some deep-seated StackOverflow cultural mandate that I wasn't aware of that would make my comments above appear foolish.

A Turing tape does not necessarily hold upper-case symbols, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One more suggestion: In computer science, there's a notion of &lt;strong&gt;oracles&lt;/strong&gt;.

On the other hand, as Suresh said, I am worried about the use of typewriter font in question titles, too, but for a different reason.  Some of the question titles are long, and typewriter font takes too much width.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not think that a mix of two fonts is bad by itself.  I am not sure if we want to use the same roman font in both question titles and question bodies just because they can contain MathJax math.  &lt;del&gt;In my (uneducated) opinion, question bodies are probably better in a roman font but question titles can be sans-serif.&lt;/del&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Edit: I removed the last sentence; see my reply to Jin in a comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="567" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:45:13.613" LastActivityDate="2010-11-30T11:49:50.503" CommentCount="4" />

As you know, SE has changed the Community Wiki policy and now only moderators can make a question a CW. Community Wiki has 2 main effects:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The question becomes owned by community, the original OP does not gain reputation,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The required reputation to edit drops to 100,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and a side effect:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The answers posted after a questions becomes a Community Wiki become Community Wiki automatically, i.e. the answers are owned by community, (but answers posted before the question becoming CW don't).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These three effects are not always correlated and there are cases that one wants to have one of these three but not the other two, e.g. the owner does not want to earn reputation but wants the users answering the question to earn reputation for their answers. So it seems to me that SE is mixing too many things in one concept and that is the main reason for many issues we had and have with CW policy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Robin brought up the idea that we should make the non-CW answers to a CW question CW also. I have a problem with answers becoming CW when the question becomes CW because sometimes the answers deserve to earn reputation, but in the current situation it makes sense, if the answers need to be CW then the previous ones also need to be CW, on the other hand a user might not have answered a question if it was a CW question so I don't know what is the right thing to do here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see three clear reasons for making a question a CW (and it would be nice to add other reasons to this list):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;OP doesn't want to earn reputation (for some reason),&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;OP wants to allow others to edit,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the question is a ranking list.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example I think a question like &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/45/what-are-good-references-to-understanding-the-proof-of-the-pcp-theorem&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2953/advice-on-good-research-practices&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; should be CW but the answers should not be and the users answering them should earn reputation for their answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that the new policy is not clear on what we should do when we think a question or answer needs to be CW, I used to flag some posts for moderator attention but don't do it any more because I now think it is not very nice to suggest someone else question or answer should be CW to the moderators, so I have decided to go with a softer way of adding comments like &quot;I would upvote it if it becomes CW&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have an proposal that I think might solve some issues and would like to hear what others think about it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In general the question or answer should be made CW only on the request of the owner (with some exceptions, see below), other users that think the post should be CW can leave a non-abusive comment like: &quot;nice answer, I would upvote it if it becomes CW&quot; and up-vote only if/when it becomes CW.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the OP is a drive-by user and does not reply to the answers or comments after considerable time,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;some clear cases like: a ranking list. These should be explicitly included in the policy,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;other special situations where the moderators have strong reasons for making a question CW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you think about this proposal (agree, disagree, opinions, improvements and suggestions, ...) and CW in general? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ps:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Another minor issue about CW is its (lack of) effect on badges, it seems strange that a user does not earn reputation but does earn badges for CW posts, e.g. I should not have earned a badges for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/174/major-unsolved-problems-in-theoretical-computer-science/218#218&quot;&gt;these answers&lt;/a&gt;. Right now many of higher level badges are awarded for CW questions/answers, which does not seem a good thing to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/239#239&quot;&gt;Official FAQ for Theoretical Computer Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/25/material-to-supplement-the-faq&quot;&gt;Material to supplement the FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;MO policy&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/6/when-should-questions-be-community-wiki&quot;&gt;https://meta.mathoverflow.net/discussion/6/when-should-questions-be-community-wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/faq#communitywiki&quot;&gt;https://mathoverflow.net/faq#communitywiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;SE policy&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/392/should-the-community-wiki-police-be-shut-down&quot;&gt;Should the community wiki police be shut down?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/67581/community-wiki-checkbox-missing-in-action&quot;&gt;Community Wiki checkbox missing in action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/67039/what-can-we-do-to-make-community-wiki-better&quot;&gt;What can we do to make Community Wiki better?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11740/what-are-community-wiki-posts&quot;&gt;What are &amp;quot;Community Wiki&amp;quot; posts?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Old discussions on cstheory meta:&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/34/community-wiki-etiquette&quot;&gt;Community Wiki Etiquette&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/62/developing-a-cw-policy&quot;&gt;Developing a CW policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/201/community-wikis&quot;&gt;Community Wikis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="186" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:57:54.527" LastActivityDate="2011-08-20T05:02:03.817" Title="The new Community Wiki policy" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;community-wiki&gt;&lt;policy&gt;" AnswerCount="4" CommentCount="8" FavoriteCount="1" CommunityOwnedDate="2010-12-06T04:10:41.780" />

Of course this site is not the right place for asking for a topic of a PhD dissertation, but I think we should accept questions like &quot;How can I put 10 thousand lines of Java code to a good TCS-related cause?&quot; (or maybe better we could create a big list of ideas for such projects). Moreover, questions like these seem welcome on mathoverflow: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/18440/what-algorithm-in-algebraic-geometry-should-i-work-on-implementing/&quot;&gt;https://mathoverflow.net/questions/18440/what-algorithm-in-algebraic-geometry-should-i-work-on-implementing/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was an undergrad I had to write thousands of lines of code in various languages, quite often with a free topic (and the topic didn't really count towards the grade, the only criterion was a solid amount of working code). It is usually the case that such projects are used just once for 10 minutes by the grader, and then thrown away - so it's like a week of effort wasted (and there are also courses where for example four people write a project together for a year, so the outcome could potentially be really something very useful).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it would be a win-win situation if researchers would be able to put on this site (for example in a big-list topic) announcements like: &quot;I need a program searching for a small counterexample for some conjecture&quot; or &quot;I have an idea for an interesting game/simulation spreading the ideas of TCS, but I don't have the time to write it&quot; and so on; the students could then use these ideas for writing their projects, and if successful they would afterwards share the result with the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="327" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:57:54.527" LastActivityDate="2010-12-12T18:27:36.990" CommentCount="2" />

I agree that the increase in the number of elementary questions is temporal, and the decrease in the ratio of answers per questions is also effected by smaller number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/big-list&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;big-list&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;big-list&lt;/a&gt; and CW questions we get which is not a bad thing by itself, the ratio is just getting closer to the ratio of questions which are not lists/CWs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if a lower ratio is a bad thing, this might be a result of the theoretical/mathematical nature of theoretical computer science. I would like to know the current ratio for MO. If we think this is a problem we should try to encourage people to provide more answers to the questions from different perspectives, e.g. by putting an entry in the FAQ explaining it that it is good and in fact &lt;em&gt;encouraged&lt;/em&gt; to post new answers even for questions which have accepted answers (assuming that the new answer is good and adds some new information).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried searching for various combinations of words related to the site. We seem to be on the top page in Google for those combinations I have tried (haven't checked Bing).

The scope of our website is often better communicated by such a list.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The quotation is unclear about where it is quoted from.  In fact, it is originally quoted from the self-description of ACM SIGACT but it seems that SIGACT has modified this description after the text was copied, so it is kind of obsolete.  For example, the current list includes computational economics and omits the reference to VLSI, both of which are understandable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I cannot see the point of emphasizing only the last sentence in the quotation from SIGACT.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The distinction between “general FAQs” and “official theoretical computer science FAQ” is confusing at best and makes no sense at worst.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest to revise the above text to the following.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/&quot;&gt;https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/&lt;/a&gt; is written very well, and I stole part of the general structure from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange&lt;/strong&gt; is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields.

It's a terrific, robust, and growing community that is clearly making an increasing contribution to the state of CS Theory research.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something we keep thinking about, though, in the context of the entire Stack Exchange network, is how broad a Stack Exchange site should be. I blogged about this a little bit &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/merging-season/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;So: the right size might be somewhere around the size of a university department. Somehow, the cultural anthropologists don’t mind sharing a building with the physical anthropologists, and when they both find themselves at the Yale-Harvard football game, you can bet that they’ll sit together and find something anthropological to talk about. Similarly, at Stack Overflow, the Java Entity Bean programmers at insurance companies don’t mind all the iPhone developers asking Objective C questions about the horrible, horrible game they’re working on. Heck, they might become iPhone developers one day. And they both share the humiliation of not being able to fix their uncle’s virus-infested Windows XP machine when they’re home for Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So that leads to the obvious question... is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; site too narrow? I don't know of many universities that have a Theoretical Computer Science department; they all have Computer Science departments and the algorithms purists don't seem to mind having Friday tea with the computer vision geeks. And the idea of meeting somebody who is working on AI is, it turns out, not &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; too horrible to contemplate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm concerned that there are non-theoretical aspects of Computer Science research that don't have a home right now. If you look around Area51 you'll see proposals for crpytography, operating systems, compilers, cognitive science, numerical modeling, computer vision, bioinformatics, history of computers, and a lot of other fields that aren't quite reaching critical mass. We had an AI site that failed to ignite due to a lack of actual AI researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying all of those are on topic, but if a university had, say, two professors interested in cognitive science, I'm pretty sure they'd just stick them into the CS department and nobody would think that was strange or upsetting or crashing the party.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now, though, I see researchers all over the computer science department that don't really have a place to participate, and the idea of making dozens of thin little sites to cover every possible ACM SIG strikes me as ignoring one of the great reasons that Stack Overflow succeeded in the first place: because we brought together &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; programmers to talk about code, and we created a reliable and robust tagging system so that you could quickly find the topics and people that you cared about, and because nobody minded (and many people enjoyed) the occasional brushing-of-shoulders with people who shared the same values but worked in different technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can we do something here? I think that sticking to &lt;em&gt;research-level&lt;/em&gt; conversation is a great common denominator, but there are an awful lot of interesting topics that are excluded right now which could really use a home. See, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;'s idea about what constitutes &quot;computer science&quot;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence; Computation and Language; Computational Complexity; Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science; Computational Geometry; Computer Science and Game Theory; Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Computers and Society; Cryptography and Security; Data Structures and Algorithms; Databases; Digital Libraries; Discrete Mathematics; Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing; Emerging Technologies; Formal Languages and Automata Theory; General Literature; Graphics; Hardware Architecture; Human-Computer Interaction; Information Retrieval; Information Theory; Learning; Logic in Computer Science; Mathematical Software; Multiagent Systems; Multimedia; Networking and Internet Architecture; Neural and Evolutionary Computing; Numerical Analysis; Operating Systems; Other Computer Science; Performance; Programming Languages; Robotics; Social and Information Networks; Software Engineering; Sound; Symbolic Computation; Systems and Control&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of that stuff is already on topic here, but a lot of it is sadly homeless in the Stack Exchange network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My belief is that broadening this site to &quot;computer science&quot; and allowing discussion on any &lt;em&gt;research-level&lt;/em&gt; topic that fits in one of the arXiv categories of Computer Science (and possibly even using those categories as tags) would make this site grow quickly into a much larger and stronger resource that attracts people in computer science departments around the world, rather than a thinner site that attempts to stitch together just the purely theoretical disciplines. Of course through the use of tags and our tag following feature, every participant could define their own filtered view of what kinds of topics they are interested in following, but if you want to reach outside of your narrow research interest once in a while there will be lots of other interesting stuff going on here too. And the opportunity to connect, even accidentally, with researchers who are ostensibly working outside of purely theoretical computer science but might, nonetheless, face the same types of problems seems like too good an opportunity to pass up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="258" LastEditorUserId="80" LastEditDate="2014-05-06T18:11:10.637" LastActivityDate="2019-02-02T10:07:05.273" Title="Is &quot;theoretical&quot; computer science too narrow?"

SE needs researchers in AI to answer AI questions and as long as they are not here nothing will change. I think all of the expected benefits of a unified site can be achieved by having multiple sites, one for each area and then having a unified &lt;em&gt;view&lt;/em&gt; like the way &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;stackexchange.com&lt;/a&gt; is unifying questions from many sites in one place (and nothing more like sharing reputation or votes).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am also concerned about some of specific points of the proposal and the issues they can create, e.g. based on Physics.SE's experience, I am clearly against sharing reputation, especially if it is going to be shared with a non-research level questions/answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I don't think we have reached a state that we can relax and start to think about ways to modify the site, the site is just a few months old, many active research areas in theory are still heavily under-represented on cstheory, we should first get more researchers on those topics on cstheory before starting to worry about AI or Graphics or Systems. That is what we should focus on. The possible benefits of any modifications to cstheory are unclear in the best case and the possible negative consequences are considerable. I think we should wait for a year to let the site stabilize, changing things just a few months after cstheory's launch is not a good thing, we want to establish a brand in theory community, we have written a SIGACT article advertising the site just a few months ago to attract researchers in theory, any dramatic change will send the wrong signal to the community. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think of cstheory as your company, would you make radical changes to its structure just after your first successful product is starting to get attention from consumers where the possible benefits of the changes are small/unclear and the risks are considerable?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="186" LastActivityDate="2011-02-14T16:03:34.720" CommentCount="3" />

If we can change this, are there any other changes that we should make?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, this is how MathOverflow generates BibTex entries:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xA;@MISC {MO23478,    &#xA;    TITLE = {Examples of common false beliefs in mathematics.},    &#xA;    AUTHOR = {gowers\phantom{x}(mathoverflow.net/users/1459)},    &#xA;    HOWPUBLISHED = {MathOverflow},    &#xA;    NOTE = {\url{https://mathoverflow.net/questions/23478} (version: 2010-05-04)},    &#xA;    EPRINT = {https://mathoverflow.net/questions/23478},    &#xA;    URL = {https://mathoverflow.net/questions/23478},    &#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This gets rendered as&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[1] gowers  (mathoverﬂow.net/users/1459).

The quality of posts so far has been excellent, from a diverse group of people, and as I write this, there are at least three posts in the pipeline to be written by contributors (i.e., not by the blog editors), so in that sense participation is good.  Where we are falling down is that we are not being read by people outside of CSTheory itself, and the number of hits per day from internet searches is very low.  I believe the second one is due to low blog pagerank, because my personal blog, which is updated far less often, gets much more traffic from searches (not counting searches for topical things like the hacker group Anonymous, which I have mentioned on my blog, but is not mentioned in the community blog).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see the following steps we can take.  Some Joe and I can just do, but others we need help on.  Also, I'd very much like to hear the ideas of others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolve once and for all our participation in the TOC Blog Aggregator.&lt;/strong&gt;  Once again, our post is not appearing there.  I have no idea what the deal is, but this one step would double our traffic.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Produce a couple static pages with useful community content.&lt;/strong&gt;  I have some time this weekend, and I will put together the page on theoretical computer science conferences, now that the community wiki question I asked to gather that information has stabilized.  &lt;em&gt;Perhaps someone else could volunteer to produce a page on links to career advice, and other such resources?&lt;/em&gt;  (If no one does, I will eventually get to it, but it might take a whiiiiile.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fully flesh out the blogroll and links of the blog.&lt;/strong&gt;  This includes having updates of other blogs when they put up a new post (so not just the names of the blogs, but one line snapshots into their content).  Point being: there is a reason for a reader to stop by, even if we have not put up a new post in a few days.  This also has the perhaps-more-important effect of making the blog appear more professional.  (An Admin might have to do this step, not sure whether Joe and I can.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change the design so it looks professional and not tacky as hell.&lt;/strong&gt;  Part of the reason that I am disappointed we're not being picked up by the TOC Aggregator is that I much prefer reading posts on the Aggregator.  The current sketchy non-design of our blog is not friendly to my eyes.  Do we need to deal with SE on this?  It would take 30 minutes max to download a WordPress theme, and that alone would raise our return traffic a nontrivial amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, thanks.

Too much personal tone can be distracting, and reducing the personal tone can improve the readability of a question (or perhaps also an answer).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this particular example, the question before the edit sounds a little like a diary rather than a question written as a question from the beginning.  It is fine in a blog, but it is probably suboptimal on a Q&amp;amp;A website.  I guess that this is why Kaveh felt the need for an edit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, in this particular example, I do not think that it was done well.

I am sorry, but I do not like how the question is stated after the edit at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, it should be pointed out that &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/300/how-to-ask-a-good-question/306#306&quot;&gt;we encourage to include a personal motivation in a question&lt;/a&gt;: we want a question which the asker cares out of his/her own interest rather than a question which the asker thinks that someone cares.  In this sense, good questions necessarily contain some personal part.  I do not think that it is right to remove everything personal from a question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thinking this way, it seems very difficult to edit a question to reduce the personal tone while maintaining some degree of personality.

The scope of cstheory is research-level. Questions that are at the level of difficulty of typical undergraduate students are not part of the scope. There are other Q&amp;amp;A sites which have a more general scope like &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Math.SE&lt;/a&gt; that would welcome questions from students.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Votes (down and up) are one of the main ways users express their opinion about the quality of a question and how interesting it is. A user may down vote a question if she/he thinks the question is off-topic or has other problems (e.g. unclear, not answerable in its current form, argumentative, not a real question, post to solicit opinion, ...).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to know why &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/8826/is-halting-that-hard-yes&quot;&gt;your question&lt;/a&gt; is down voted you can ask for that in place of attacking other users. I will explain my down vote in more detail below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that you are trying to find a way to get around the undecidability of halting problem. The halting problem (as it is defined in the literature) is undecidable and that is a mathematical theorem. Now one might be interested in decidable variations of halting problem. That is a well studied topic, and one can ask a research level question about that. There are also researchers working on these kind of problems who try to find ways to deal with undecidability in practice (mainly in formal methods community, but also in theoretical computer science). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand your question has no sign that you are familiar with the literature. I can tell that this is something a typical undergraduate student taking their first course in computability would ask. It is nice that a student would think about this kind of problems.

If you ask it on Math.SE you probably will not get any down votes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an analogy, it is completely fine and even encouraged that students ask questions like this in an undergraduate computability class from the instructor. Asking it in a research-level computability workshop will probably be unwelcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you ask a question about halting problem and show that you are familiar with the literature and understand the basics in the area, and the question is a real question (posting a question to see how others think about your idea about how to solve halting problem is not a real question) and is clearly stated (can be answered without much back-and-forth comments where others try to guess what you want to ask, which can be a sign that the question is not well-thought), then that can be on-topic and I would guess would not receive any down votes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ps:&#xA;I would suggest that you take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/faq#questions-should-be-based-on-knowledge-sharing-not-on-shirking&quot;&gt;this section of the FAQ&lt;/a&gt; and also the pages linked there.

While I try to judge this proposal on its own merit, it is likely that the time and energy I have invested in CS.SE influences me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid that broadening the scope in this way would destroy the existing community. A Stack Exchange site is defined by two things: the kind of questions it accepts, and the audience it attracts. Even though each question is in principle judged on its intrinsic merits, the long-term effect is to create a community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On this site, the community is centered around researchers in theoretical computer science. Participants tend to be researchers in TCS, researchers in other fields, or graduate students aspiring to become researchers. The participants who are welcomed are generally those who came with the expectation of participating in a community dominated by TCS researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not see a problem with allowing more applied questions. As long as academics and people who want to fit in with academics dominate the site, that isn't a problem. It may be difficult to bootstrap an applied CS community (it would have been a lot easier to do when the site was young), but if it works, it won't change the tone of the site, and if it fails, the site won't have changed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, opening the door to more basic questions means opening the door to a broader audience. This should be a carefully controlled process. In particular, I advise you not to try to draw on Stack Overflow as an audience base. A majority of Stack Overflow does not know or care what it means to be a scientist. The kind of people you would attract are those who now post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Programmers&lt;/a&gt;. If you attract those people, be prepared to moderate their content. And to moderate them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reacting to specific points in your proposal:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We now have a natural forum (cs.stackexchange.com) for the more &quot;basic&quot; algorithms questions, and the cstheory &quot;brand&quot; is well established as a 'research-only' venue. So we have an easy process to shunt questions that are obviously undergrad level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that CS.SE is not exclusively for basic questions. It is for questions at all level, ranging all the way from CS 101 homework to applied research (and even research in theory, but we suggest CSTheory.SE to the rare asker who comes with a theory question that seems to go unanswered because it is too hard).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;excluding questions from people who might be 'research-level' in a sub area but aren't experts in some other domain&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From what I see (I admit to not following CSTheory.SE very closely), this already happens: as long as there's a feeling that peers are talking with peers, questions tend to be appreciated, left open and answered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;creating the impression of an unfriendly site (which is a bigger problem in terms of maintaining the audience)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the community is doing an adequate job of retaining the audience it likes in and keeping the undesirables in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All in all, while the current guidelines may be stricter than this, I think an intelligent application of the existing policies already gives you what you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="634" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:48:30.257" LastActivityDate="2012-08-12T23:30:32.150" CommentCount="1" />

sketch something out that can be used as a point for further discussion because its a direction/approach Ive been thinking about &amp;amp; looking into &amp;amp; even veering towards myself &amp;amp; its key to this group. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this question is probably a little too hypothetical. in principle you could build a paper by stringing together some stackexchange answers but it would be unusual. as mod kaveh writes, each question must stand on its own separate merit and also note, few people regularly post questions here or with high frequency esp those with high rep, and there is some possibility that frequent questions are actually informally frowned on via the voting mechanisms &amp;amp; current collective voting tendencies. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the pattern is more in general that high rep users answer random newcomer questions. also, it is unlikely that you would get solid answers to all the separate (presumably nontrivial) questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;basically yes, that is part of the &lt;em&gt;raison d'etre&lt;/em&gt; of the group, to occasionally collaboratively generate scientific research to theoretical computer science in general &amp;amp; complexity theory in particular (complexity theory entries even were once highlighted here in css formatting). however the conventions around this are new &amp;amp; still being established as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1st, use the stackexchange search engine highly extensively and also the tag system, both can be very effective. find every relevant post to your paper or subject. figure out the best knowledge that is posted on the group. figure out the border between the known and unknown and what is posted vs not posted. this also requires close familiarity with nearby papers. it helps to bookmark or &quot;favorite&quot; all related posts on here &amp;amp; elsewhere. use the related posts column on the right also. mix this with heavy cross use of google. in some cases you may find an expert on here posting on the subj. you can look at their own answers &amp;amp; look at their papers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;next, try posting a single carefully crafted question totally centered on your subject and your paper and what you're thinking of establishing. its a delicate mix between the general (background) and the specific (the new result/concept you're aiming for). as if you have a single chance to ask the experts what you'd most want to know but what you also most think they'd be able to answer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;responses will help you figure out what is known by the crowd but also how relevant it is to this group based on reaction in form of comments, enthusiasm, voting, etc. it has to be at a &quot;just right difficulty&quot; between too easy [not research] and too hard [you wont get replies/answers]. it takes some time to find that balance &amp;amp; its an ongoing challenge. dont assume that if there is a good answer, someone will post it. dont assume that if people post answers, those are the best possible. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;you will prob find if you are very focused that there are two gaps. one is the gap between what you want to establish in your paper and what is established in related literature. the other gap is what you can actually find out by using this group (both by searching it and posting questions). these two gaps are interrelated. you can judge whether you can build on all this with meaningful new results. but those key results will basically have to be generated by you, nobody else, unless you have found &lt;em&gt;offline&lt;/em&gt;

My view of its proper use would include giving background to the result or other subject matter which the reference refers to, motivating why the subject itself is interesting to look into. However, that's also my opinion regarding all questions. Simply asking &quot;I need a reference for problem X&quot; seems on a par for brusqueness as simply asking &quot;Can we detect jeejaws in 2-whatsis-graphs in $O(n^{3.1})$ time?&quot; without further elaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a field as broad and sometimes as particular as Theoretical Computer Science, even those who mostly ask questions can provide value for the website by adding context so that those unfamiliar with a particular subject can learn something new from the question alone. My attitude towards the &lt;code&gt;reference-request&lt;/code&gt;  tag is informed by the fact that the field is wide, with many narrow crevices. You certainly don't want reference requests to dominate, because this site is not meant to be a library. But for a narrow enough topic, sometimes the only adequate librarian is someone who is intimately familiar with the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suppose having a specific &lt;code&gt;reference-request&lt;/code&gt; tag is not necessary to allow such questions on here, but I would be unhappy if such questions were disallowed.

Scott Aaronson in his blog sometimes uses the scenario of super-intelligent alien beings having a discussion with us to emphasise the universality of certain notions in mathematics or computer science. This post felt like a very scaled-down but realistic form of that thought experiment. A person from a different, but closely related field comes to us and says, &quot;we do logic, you do logic, and we have all these cool results, but what do you have to show for your logic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to tell from the wording how deep the author's knowledge of classical mathematical logic is, but the question does request for answers that appeal to advanced logical concepts. I was absolutely gung-ho about writing an answer because questions that specifically want and advanced-level survey are rare. A couple of hours later, I realised that this was never going to end. I'm glad to see that the question has now been made community wiki. I think my current answer is too long and should be split into different answers. I have three concrete proposals for answers to that question. Please let me know if you agree with these proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proposal 1&lt;/em&gt;. Every answer discusses a specific sub-area of computational logic and consists of three paragraphs. The first paragraph give a high-level overview of the field aimed at researchers in mathematics or TCS. The second paragraph highlights some results in the field and techniques used to prove those results. The third paragraph mentions current directions and open problems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proposal 2&lt;/em&gt;. We make a &quot;table of contents&quot; answer that lists different sub-areas of computational logic and hyperlinks to the different answers. Anyone can add to this list, and then add a separate answer for the area mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proposal 3.&lt;/em&gt; If the OP agrees, we modify the original question a bit to make explicit the structure desired for answers. (We could also do this in the ToC answer I suggest in Proposal 2, but people might not read other answers before replying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel such an advanced research summary would be a valuable resource for the future reference, and that obtaining such a survey via our user base would be effective. If it works here, we could also follow a similar protocol/structure for certain other broad reference requests. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What say ye?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4155" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.560" LastActivityDate="2013-01-14T07:01:27.920" Title="Help answering the &quot;CS applications of logic&quot; question" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;" AnswerCount="0" CommentCount="2" />

But I think people have been too quick to label some questions as &quot;too elementary&quot;, when in fact they describe very real research-level questions.

(For the first question: Sorting requires $\Omega(n\log n)$ comparisons.  For the second question: Hilbert's 10th is undecidable.)  But if we look past those easy answers, these are legitimate research-level questions in theoretical computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, but then how does one prove lower bounds for problems that can't be solved by comparison trees?  Or lower bounds bigger than $\Omega(n\log n)$ for problems solvable in polynomial time?  Or exponential lower bounds for NP-hard problems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, but then how does one actually find integer roots of polynomials in practice?  Are there effective algorithms for broad and interesting classes of polynomials?  Are there algorithms with provable approximation guarantees (for interesting classes of polynomials)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the deeper question is likely not what the original poster intended.

It would be nice if the moderators here would avoid migrating low-quality questions to CS.SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I noticed recently a few low-quality questions that were migrated to the Computer Science Stack Exchange (CS.SE) site.  I would suggest that we avoid doing that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it's a good question, and on-topic for CS.SE, I definitely encourage you to migrate to CS.SE.  For instance, if it is not research-level but would be a reasonable question, migrating to CS.SE is a great idea.  Go for it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if it's a bad question -- one that would be a bad question for CS.SE -- please don't migrate it to CS.SE.  If it's a bad question, just close it, don't migrate it.  Please don't make CS.SE a dumping ground for bad questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it's a good question -- well-researched, on-topic, focused, narrow -- but has some English/grammar problems, don't let that stop you from migrating.  If it's just the English, we can edit it over at CS.SE.  But if it is a fundamentally bad question -- e.g., not well-researched, or a duplicate, or unclear -- I personally don't think it should be migrated over to CS.SE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One recent example: &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18536/5038&quot;&gt;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/18536/5038&lt;/a&gt;.  In my opinion, that question shouldn't have been migrated to CS.SE.  It is not a good fit for the Computer Science Stack Exchange.  The question does not show evidence of effort.  It asks a question about a topic that is already covered by reference questions at CS.SE, with no evidence that the question-asker was aware of that.  These issues are not something that those of us at CS.SE can fix through simple edits to the question.  Of course, that's just one example.  I don't mean to pick on that one or focus on that one too much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kaveh explains that the CS.SE admins specifically requested that &quot;badly written&quot; questions are still OK to migrate to CS.SE.  I didn't realize that!  That explains a lot.  Perhaps that's something we should discuss.  I'm not sure whether &quot;badly written&quot; refers to the English/grammar, or to more fundamental issues (like whether it's a good question, whether it is well-researched, whether it is on-topic and focused and detailed and not a duplicate).  If the former, I agree, English/grammar problems should not be a barrier to migration.  If the latter, well, I guess I might have a slight difference of opinion with the CS.SE admins -- maybe that's something we need to discuss on CS.meta, instead of here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I certainly don't mean to imply that this is a huge, systemic problem that requires major changes to migration, and I don't mean to imply the moderators here are doing anything wrong (I think the moderators are doing a great job!).

You see…” → migrate to CS.SE.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“Ok, here's a hint to solve this exercise, try it and come back.” → migrate to CS.SE.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“Gee, a programming question.” → migrate to SO if you think it's a really good question, otherwise close as off-topic.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If none of the categories applies, use your judgement. There is obviously room for subjectivity. Where does &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/13578/omega-of-a-polynomial-function&quot;&gt;Omega of a polynomial function&lt;/a&gt; fit? I would close and answer with a comment linking to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Properties&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, because it's a really elementary question. Also, technically, it isn't a computer science question, it's a math question that falls short of reaching a CS application. I wouldn't say that migrating it is fundamentally wrong, but it is a bit of a waste of effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If in doubt — if the question is not great but not crap either — you might as well migrate.

We have discussed previously (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1264/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1395/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) that we are not going to require or even demand people to explain their votes. When I see a down-vote that I don't understand I politely comment that I don't understand it, but I think demanding an explanation or stating that there is no reason for the down-vote goes too far. It is not an abuse if people are using their votes in a way different from us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have argued a number of times that I am against counter-voting, that is voting to null the effect of another user's vote. Everyone has their own opinion. The total reflects the opinion of the community, it is not the job of any particular user to decide what the total should be. Counter-voting encourages other users to do the same and use their votes to null votes in place of express their opinion about the question. Each vote is a manifestation of some user's opinion and if we respect their opinions then we should respect their votes even when we disagree with them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it is more productive if we comment and explain why we think it is a suitable and interesting question in place of just asking others why they have down-voted the post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this particular case, I see several possible reasons for a down-vote. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formating: It is using an image in place of writing the expression which I think has been one of the reasons people down-vote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content: The questions seems to simply ask how to calculate some expression for some particular values. It seems to ask how to apply a method explained in a paper in a particular case in practice. It is too localized and it doesn't seem to be a &lt;em&gt;research-level&lt;/em&gt; question in &lt;em&gt;theoretical&lt;/em&gt; computer science. It is also unclear what is the trouble the OP is facing in calculating the expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you ask me I think we are being too open right now (I guess it is partly because people get bored that there are not as many questions as they would like) to questions which should not be here and are more suitable for CS.SE. E.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/18703/are-randomized-algorithms-considered-as-complete&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/18628/confused-about-disparity-and-depth-map&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/18886/proof-that-turing-machine-and-lambda-calculus-are-equivalent&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/18575/pigeon-holing-or-bucketing-a-number-based-on-a-set-of-ranges&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; have been in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools?tab=close&amp;amp;daterange=last30days&quot;&gt;the closing review queue&lt;/a&gt; for sometime but have not been put &lt;em&gt;on-hold&lt;/em&gt;.

I think such problems will not be frequent here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is your personal view of the role that CSTheory should/will/does play in the greater TCS community?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it could be (and already is) a great resource for the community.  It would be great if most TCS researchers joined this site and participated.  However, the site's role in the community may evolve organically, as these things often do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Practically, one of the most important roles of a moderator, is to decide which questions to close, if at all. There are several attitudes toward this problem. Do you think that referring specifically to the user who asks the question and his or her perceived capabilities (e.g., &quot;lack of mathematical maturity&quot;, as expressed by some moderators) is a legitimate reason (or part of a reason) for closing a question? Or should you judge a question only by its own merits?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mostly by its own merits.  If you know that the person asking the question is, for example, a famous researcher, then it makes sense to re-evaluate the question with this in mind.  But a bad question is a bad question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators basically should try to keep the site running smoothly with as little intervention as possible.  This involves deleting content that doesn't belong, stopping arguments that get out of hand, guiding new users, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's fine with me.  (Though if I were running the stackexchange site, I might have chosen a different design decision.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The software makes moderator votes immediately binding, so this lets them resolve egregious issues more quickly.  Of course moderators also have access even 20k users do not.  However, more importantly, because moderators are elected by the community, they can speak for the community in a way high rep users cannot.  This also means that moderators should be more careful in what they say and how they use their privileges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We often get low quality or obsolete or chatty flags. Based on early discussions the moderators normally don't take any action and dismiss them as not requiring moderator intervention. Do you think we should continue this way or change the policy?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This seems to make sense as a policy.  But I don't have experience dealing with flags, so if Suresh or the other mods think the policy needs to be changed, I'd defer to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This is one of my concerns about long term health of the site. Do you consider the primary goal of this Q&amp;amp;A site to be helping researchers in theoretical computer science and related fields to get help with their research? &lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  If you do how should we deal with persistent trouble making users who try to abuse the site for their own wishes? E.g. users who are not researchers in theoretical computer science or any related field and insist on posting questions/answers/comments that are off-topic by the site's policies, e.g. cranks that want to use the site to verify or draw attention to their attempts on famous open problems? &lt;br/&gt;&#xA;  How can we make sure the site will not be overridden by users who are not researchers so cstheory does not suffer the faith of other online open resources for researchers like Usenet groups? (Keep in mind that with the current amount of community participation in closing we are going to have very serious trouble if the number of such users with 3k+ reputation reaches 5).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bigger such problems become, the more active moderators have to be.  So far, we've been pretty good at closing crank questions.  I would strongly prefer questions be closed by the community, and I would try to cast close votes only as fifth votes.  However, if the site gets over-run by attention-seekers and it becomes evident that the community is ill-equipped to deal with them, then I (in consultation with the other mods) would become more active in closing and deleting content.  If certain people are persistently abusing the site, they can be suspended.  If the scope of this site is to change, it should be by community discussion, not by spammers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="123" LastEditorUserId="123" LastEditDate="2014-01-28T02:53:49.773" LastActivityDate="2014-01-28T02:53:49.773" CommentCount="0" />

Searching for mathematical knowledge is quite difficult, especially when you are even a little bit away from your core field of expertise. The combined expertise of CSTheory participants is a really effective way for finding that elusive theorem, or reference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is another role of CSTheory that I care very much about, but is harder to explain. What I have in mind is closely related to Thurston's &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9404236&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;On Proof and Progress in Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;. As with other fields of math, we record progress in TCS in a formal style in technical papers. We also give technical talks, and seminars. However TCS is much more than a collection of proven theorems, and algorithms. A community of researchers shares intuitions, heuristics, mental models, and all of these are essential to making progress in TCS and keeping it alive. Mind you, often these insights are specific to subfields of TCS.  These aspects of our culture are hard to capture in technical articles and talks, and we need other means of communicating them. This can be through tutorials, workshops, expository writing, monographs. And also through CSTheory. Here a researcher unfamiliar with some subfield of TCS can tap the collective wisdom of experts, ask for the intuitions and motivations behind theorems, proofs, and definitions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the flags are caused by the user's breaching community guidelines and by disrespectful behavior, I would warn them via comments. If this is not effective, and the disrespectful behavior continues, I would suspend them for a period of time. If the user's behavior makes CSTheory hostile and unwelcoming, this will likely put off many other users. The &quot;steady stream of valuable answers&quot; will not be worth losing many other valuable experts and making CSTheory unpopular. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would bring up the question in meta, so that we can both get feedback from the community. At the end of the day, community consensus should prevail, and I would of course accept the consensus decision, no matter whether I entirely agree with it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is your personal view of the role that CSTheory should/will/does play in the greater TCS community?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To a large extent this is answered by what I wrote for the first question. In order for CSTheory to play the role I wrote about, we would need participation from experts in most of the active fields of TCS. I think there are fields where we would benefit from wider representation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Practically, one of the most important roles of a moderator, is to decide which questions to close, if at all. There are several attitudes toward this problem. Do you think that referring specifically to the user who asks the question and his or her perceived capabilities (e.g., &quot;lack of mathematical maturity&quot;, as expressed by some moderators) is a legitimate reason (or part of a reason) for closing a question? Or should you judge a question only by its own merits?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think basing decisions on the level of maturity of the user is the wrong way to go. Questions should stand on their own. It may be rare that an inexperienced user stumbles into a nice, specific enough question, but it has happened. At the end, the artefact that remains for the community is the question and the answers. And if a question is close enough, it can be edited to make it just right (but reworking questions entirely is not acceptable). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand there are questions that are so broad and vague that they do capture, almost by accident, some deep issue. It is better if such question is closed, but feedback is given to the users so that they can improve their question to focus on the interesting issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators resolve issues (by resolving flags and closing questions) that need immediate attention, and where the action to be taken is clear (in terms of broad consensus or accepted community rules). Moreover, by virtue of their role, they can and should start discussions on issues important to the community, and they should lead by example in setting standards in CSTheory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It will be a reminder to act in balanced and responsible way. But it will not change the way I answer and ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Binding close votes would enable me to take immediate action where such action is needed. The ability to suspend users would allow me to deal with particularly disruptive situations, in extreme cases. Moreover, the status as a moderator would allow me to lead by example in setting community standards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We often get low quality or obsolete or chatty flags. Based on early discussions the moderators normally don't take any action and dismiss them as not requiring moderator intervention. Do you think we should continue this way or change the policy?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do agree that a low quality flag that does not point to a real issue does not require intervention. A chatty flag that does raise a legitimate concern (in a chatty way) may require attention, however. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This is one of my concerns about long term health of the site.

I think the community has been good at downvoting and closing low-quality questions, and questions that clearly have an agenda that is incompatible with the goals of the site. We have also been mostly good at downvoting low-quality answers. Unfortunately, over a long period of time a user can collect a substantial amount of points from a large number of mediocre answers (say no more helpful than a Google search). The best way I can see of addressing this situation within the system is prompt moderator action in closing questions that are posted simply to draw attention to a crank's attempts at solutions of open problems. The site's tools should work fine if the level of participation from the community is high, and in order to keep the community's interest in the site we need to keep the questions on topic (research level, in TCS). Besides using the moderation tools, leaving comments on inappropriate questions, moderators could also set an example by posting questions that are at the appropriate level for CSTheory, or by encouraging users to post good questions/answers initially left in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4896" LastEditorUserId="4896" LastEditDate="2014-01-22T04:27:30.660" LastActivityDate="2014-01-22T04:27:30.660" CommentCount="0" />

This website allows me to keep my finger on the pulse of other subfields and see what sort of questions are interesting others and how they think about certain problems. As such, I think cstheory is primarily a great way to bring the community together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, my hope is to use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://egtheory.wordpress.com/2013/09/15/algorithmic-lens/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;algorithmic lens&lt;/a&gt; as a viewpoint on other sciences and I hope others do so as well. If non-computer scientists start using tools from cstheory then this website (and its placement among other science and math websites in the SE network) could provide a great way for us to engage with them, and share our knowledge while figuring out what problems they want to use our tools to address.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would address the specific flags through comments, discuss with the other moderators, and if the behavior persists contact the user over chat. If direct communication with the user does not resolve the issue then I would consider a suspension for some amount of time and contact over email (if such means are available).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would contact the mod in private. If after a discussion we are still unsure of the decision then I would raise the question in meta for input from the community. However, I doubt this would come up since in my experience so far I have not seen closed questions for which I disagreed with closing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is your personal view of the role that CSTheory should/will/does play in the greater TCS community?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my answer to the first question, I described my views for this site in cstheory and the larger scientific community. I think we are already moving toward this organically, but it might help to show more clearly why cstheory is a worthwhile part of a researcher's workflow by generating more answers to lists like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/784/1037&quot;&gt;Original proofs generated on the parent site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1257/1037&quot;&gt;References to cstheory in the literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Practically, one of the most important roles of a moderator, is to decide which questions to close, if at all. There are several attitudes toward this problem. Do you think that referring specifically to the user who asks the question and his or her perceived capabilities (e.g., &quot;lack of mathematical maturity&quot;, as expressed by some moderators) is a legitimate reason (or part of a reason) for closing a question? Or should you judge a question only by its own merits?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to judge questions by their own merit. The only time I would let my knowledge of the users previous activity affect my decision is if I am unsure about the questions. However, in these cases of being unsure, I will never act before the community voices their opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a special case of questions that accidentally capture a deeper issue, and are simple when read at a surface level but significant at a deeper level. In this case, I think it is important to engage with the user through comments to see if this deeper exploration will serve the user, or if they were just looking for the easy answer. This is often a judgement of the users &quot;mathematical maturity&quot;. If they were not looking for a deeper discussion, and the question is fine otherwise, I would consider migration to CS.SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators should interfere as little as possible with community self-governance, and act decisively only in clear cut cases where the community guidelines are already set. Moderators should also act as unbiased intermediaries in case of heated discussions and encourage good behavior by example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It will not change how I ask or answer questions. However, I will actively take note to make sure my comments are always unbiased, constructive, and within community norms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only differences I know is the binding vote and diamond (I guess there are also some drastic actions like suspension, but I will hopefully never have to use those). As someone that spends an unreasonable amount of time on the internet, the binding vote will allow me to act decisively and quickly in clear cut cases. Since &quot;close&quot; now means &quot;on hold&quot;, this will hopefully improve questions. The diamond will allow me to set a good example in my actions on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;We often get low quality or obsolete or chatty flags. Based on early discussions the moderators normally don't take any action and dismiss them as not requiring moderator intervention. Do you think we should continue this way or change the policy?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would encourage use of our third space (i.e. the chat room) to avoid some of the chatty discussions. However, otherwise I would leave the decision on this policy to more experienced moderators or the community (maybe we should raise a meta discussion on this?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This is one of my concerns about long term health of the site. Do you consider the primary goal of this Q&amp;amp;A site to be helping researchers in theoretical computer science and related fields to get help with their research?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my first answer, I see helping researchers with their research as only part of the goals of this site. I think it is also a way to communicate with other disciplines, and a way to build community. Further, it is a way for future researchers to keep an idea of what the community is interested in, and learn from reading others questions and answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If you do how should we deal with persistent trouble making users who try to abuse the site for their own wishes? E.g. users who are not researchers in theoretical computer science or any related field and insist on posting questions/answers/comments that are off-topic by the site's policies, e.g. cranks that want to use the site to verify or draw attention to their attempts on famous open problems?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We already have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/q/274/1037&quot;&gt;policy on crank-friendly preprints and topics&lt;/a&gt;, I will enforce this policy. I don't think we have gotten too many problems with cranky users, especially compared to other SE sites. We have a great community that already deals with this well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How can we make sure the site will not be overridden by users who are not researchers so cstheory does not suffer the faith of other online open resources for researchers like Usenet groups? (Keep in mind that with the current amount of community participation in closing we are going to have very serious trouble if the number of such users with 3k+ reputation reaches 5).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can make sure of this by continuing to ask great research-level questions and providing amazing answers. However, I do agree that the reputation mechanism on the site is broken and it is easy for a persistent user to accumulate reputation. These sort of users are unavoidable, and in most cases they don't cause much trouble.

If you type &quot;crank meaning&quot; into Google, you will see both of these meanings (among others):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;an eccentric person, especially one who is obsessed by a particular subject or theory.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a bad-tempered person.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Referring to someone as either &quot;bad-tempered&quot; or &quot;eccentric&quot; is generally considered rude.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to suggest that users who are seeking to make an observation about another user's &#xA;interests in mathematics or computer science use the word &quot;enthusiast&quot; instead of &quot;crank.&quot;  For example, if someone called another user a &quot;P vs. NP enthusiast,&quot; this would not be rude or considered bullying.

It sounds like you are just asking a question about a calculation using queueing theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it a question about &lt;em&gt;theoretical computer science&lt;/em&gt;?  Well, not so much.  It's more a quantitative question about distributed systems and performance modelling.  I don't see any theoretical/foundational issue here.

I find the database stuff unclear.  OK, so we have to use a database, but you haven't told us how the database affects throughput.  What's the throughput of the database if you use a single centralized system?  What's the throughput of the database if you use a distributed system?  And does each serve do the database query in parallel with handling the request, or sequentially?  Those will affect the answer.  It's also not clear why you are telling about the costs of storage or the costs of small servers when that doesn't affect the final answer; as far as I can tell, all you are asking is how to maximize throughput, for which cost is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I find the question unclear and in need of clarification before it should be asked on any site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5038" LastActivityDate="2014-07-23T23:21:39.763" CommentCount="0" />

It seems like it would be a good experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tricky bit is to select the criteria for which questions would be shown.  I can see two plausible possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative 1: Have a set of tags which are eligible for this, e.g., algorithms, complexity-theory, computability, undecidability, etc.  Any question with vote total of 10+ and with at least one tag in the whitelist would then be eligible to be shown on CSTheory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This might whittle down the list of questions to those that are related to theoretical computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it has the problem that many of the questions selected in this way will not be research-level.  There are a lot of questions on CS.SE with 10+ votes that are not research-level questions in theoretical computer science, and they might be unwelcome on CSTheory.  Take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions?sort=votes&quot;&gt;top questions on CS.SE&lt;/a&gt; sorted by vote total, or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/complexity-theory?sort=votes&amp;amp;pageSize=50&quot;&gt;top questions on CS.SE with the complexity-theory tag&lt;/a&gt; and you'll see what I mean.  Only a small fraction of the highest-voted questions there would be a good fit for CSTheory; the majority would not be useful to display on CSTheory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I looked at the top 50 highest-voted questions on CS.SE with the complexity-theory tag.  All of them have a vote total of 10 or higher.  By my own highly personal assessment, about 10 of them look like they would be good to display on the CSTheory.SE front page.  The others don't look like great candidates (they are elementary, of narrow interest, or were about proving NP-hardness of a specific problem and the question has already been solved).  A 20% hit rate isn't great.  But this is my own personal taste, and others may differ.  I encourage readers to do their own count, see what they get, and post their own evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative 2: Allow moderators to select which questions are eligible for display in this way.

The first is that it allows the election process to proceed in a way that allows candidates to be evaluated before being elected. It also serves to indicate that there are enough people in the community who are willing to handle the responsibilities of overseeing moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Theoretical Computer Science is not a site that's particularly in danger of low moderation. There's a healthy number of regular users across most reputation brackets who remain active on the site, still handling general moderation tasks.  The flag load itself isn't particularly large, and the current moderation team has expressed that they aren't overwhelmed by it. However, only one of the current moderators is highly active - while this is sufficient for the current flag load, it is healthier for the site to have multiple active moderators, not only to split even the small loads but also to handle situations where one of the moderators may have more pressing matters to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It could be that now is just not a good time to have hosted an election for this site.

What approach will you take?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are some easy cases: if a comment is just pointing out a mistake and that has already been fixed, then the comment is probably no longer needed. Also, if a comment no longer makes sense because related comments have already been deleted, it should make sense to delete. Moreover, if someone goes out of their way and flags a comment like &quot;Thanks!&quot; as no longer needed, I'd tend to go along with that. On the other hand, comments are often substantial and should be kept.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;I have a bit the impression that part of the reason why the &quot;inactivity&quot; of the moderators came to the attention of SE was the question &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/38803/is-norbert-blums-2017-proof-that-p-ne-np-correct&quot;&gt;Is Norbert Blum&amp;#39;s 2017 proof that $P \ne NP$ correct?&lt;/a&gt; which attracted some inappropriate content and corresponding flags. Those flags stayed around for a long time before they were handled. But apart from that episode, I never had the impression that cstheory.se would need more active moderators, the community self-moderation felt sufficient. Should moderators stay inactive as long as the self-moderation of the community works well?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually, I hope so, as I have only so much time to spend! :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case, SE has an official document about this -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/05/18/a-theory-of-moderation/&quot;&gt;A Theory of Moderation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The user should receive some friendly hints that they are being problematic. If that doesn't help I would discuss with other moderators and then there is the possibility of a temporary suspension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;f it seemed very unreasonable to me I would probably discuss it with the other moderator; if only borderline I'd just let it go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deal with flags (by the way I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/users/flag-summary/4600&quot;&gt;100% helpful flag record on MathOverflow&lt;/a&gt;) and some other things discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/05/18/a-theory-of-moderation/&quot;&gt;A Theory of Moderation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments.

A few of them include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Top banner is shorter in height, so some artwork has to be adjusted along with some logos.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Left Navigation is active everywhere (but can be collapsed into a menu by visiting your site preferences - &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/311237/284336&quot;&gt;instructions here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Responsive layout is active, which lets the site adjust as browser widths change - no side scrolling (some pages haven't been updated, yet, though). For now, if you prefer the scrolling, you can disable this by clicking the &quot;disable responsiveness&quot; link in the footer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many site elements including tags and voting arrows are standardized across the network.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Link underlining is active.

My bachelor thesis included a survey on hierarchy theorems and hierarchies in Computational Complexity, as well as investigating the possibilities of improving the deterministic time hierarchy theorem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently I am investigating algebraic complexity theory, especially in relation with the recent sequence of results based on depth reduction that have come close to separating VP and VNP. I am interested in so called &quot;separating modules&quot;, which are sets of polynomials that characterize complexity classes and provide a common framework for many algebraic circuit lower bound proofs. I wish to investigate the inherent strengths and weaknesses of this framework, whether it is possible to utilize it in producing new proofs in the area of algebraic complexity theory and how it can be &quot;translated&quot; to the boolean world. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another research interest of mine is structural complexity theory. I am highly interested in the polynomial hierarchy and determining the relations between classes in the hierarchy and other classes related to it. I am also acquainted with communication complexity, which I studied to some extent after receiving my BSc degree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since Fall 2012, I am pursuing a Ms/PhD degree in Saarland university. During this time, I have completed a variety of advanced courses, including ones in Complexity Theory, Algorithms and Data Structures and Graph Theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" Views="30" UpVotes="131" DownVotes="4" AccountId="485049" />
