Given the responses to [my previous question here on Meta][1], you want to be inclusive of multiple skill levels.

There are [three][3] [relevant][4] [discussions][5] on their Meta that I could find. The Mathematics community appears to be doing quite well in terms of having people of various skill levels (appears to range from undergraduate university-level mathematics on up), their tagging appears to be working quite well, and I honestly find it easier to read and search than MathOverflow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But really, if this Stack Exchange follows MathOverflow, I actually see someone else coming along and making another Computer Science exchange geared toward a broader audience, in terms of skill levels. I think that this exchange can avoid this splintering of the community (avoiding another Unix/Linux versus Ubuntu Stack Exchange problem) by catering to as many people of various skill levels and educational backgrounds as possible. Yes, you need a specific focus on certain topics and clearly define what is and is not on-topic, but you want to segregate based on those topics, not by knowledge or experience. By dumping the arVix style tags, you make it easy for everyone to find questions/answers, but also make the site friendlier to less knowledgeable and experienced people such as myself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that's not to say that arVix isn't useful. I believe Stack Exchanges have the &quot;tag wiki&quot; page that Stack Overflow has.

I have an interest in many computer science topics, but I rarely read computer science publications, have never browsed arVix, and really don't want to learn how to use such a system that I'll never use off of this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I routinely read other publications of papers by the IEEE (in fact, I have the most recent issue of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering next to me right now). Papers in this publication have &quot;index terms&quot; - keywords that describe what the paper is about. I grabbed a copy of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology out of my shelf, and they have three sections: categories and subject descriptions (which contain a code as well as textual descriptions), general terms, and additional key words/phrases. Whenever I've searched for papers in an online database, my matches have always come from the keywords sections or the body of the paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at these tags, they are unwieldy.

If you aren't familiar with microformats, search engines actually do pick up on them and they do help people find pages. People who do searches search for things like &quot;data structure&quot; and &quot;data structures&quot;, not &quot;cs.DS.data-structures&quot;. The tags should reflect what people are searching on Google and Bing so that they are brought to questions on Stack Exchanges that are relevant to their searches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also want to address a few comments and other postings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another point that I've read in [some postings and comments here][6] is that you want to maintain compatibility with MathOverflow. I think this is a mistake. MathOverflow is a Stack Exchange 1.0 site and, last I heard, had no intention of migrating to Stack Exchange 2.0. However, there are a number of Stack Exchange 2.0 sites that might be of interest to this community in some way that are at various levels of existance - Stack Overflow (people might ask algorithm or data structure implementation questions here), Mathematics (which includes discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorics...), Statistical Analysis (which includes machine learning), Not Programming Related, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Application Security, Machine Learning, Numerical Modeling and Simulation, Signal Processing, Operating systems Development, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, and Cryptography (and those are just the first 10 pages of proposals, sorted by progress). These are the communities that need to work together to decide what best belongs where, especially since it appears that there will be a feature to move questions between various Stack Exchange 2.0 sites. Unless things change on MathOverflow, you will never be able to migrate a question from here to MO. However, in the future, it will be possible to migrate questions to the exchanges I mentioned, and so far, none of them are using ArVix tagging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As [first mentioned in a comment here][7], some of the ArVix tags are long. Potentially too long to fit in the limit of a tag. The purpose of tags is to help people search and sort through questions. If you start abbreviating ArVix tags, you open up a whole new can of worms with the best way to abbreviate the tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/115&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://math.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/48/should-mathoverflow-tag-prefixes-be-used&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/186/setting-things-straight-what-style-of-tags-are-we-going-to-be-using-when-we-laun&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://meta.math.stackexchange.com/questions/59/mathoverflow-tags-others&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/74#74&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/42#42&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag" />

If you just take the top-level tags and mark some of them as &quot;interesting&quot; and some &quot;ignored&quot;, you'll immediately have a very effective filter. If we have the policy that each question is tagged with at least one &quot;top level tag&quot;, your filter should work pretty well. On the other hand, if we just have a large collection of tags that people can use and create however they want, maintaining your filter and keeping it effective (and spotting false positives/negatives) becomes a burden.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't think it matters if you have top-level tags for filtering. It's good to have very specific, well-defined tags that mean something specific and where many people know their meaning. Having ambiguous words/phrases/keywords as tags would be a problem, but it doesn't matter what the tag is as long as anyone can look at it and tell what it is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In terms of the use of any tags - I would like to first point out Stack Overflow, Super User, and Server Fault. They allow for random tags, yet the users are able to find and filter based on their preferences. It all boils down to the fact that in a folksonomy, the tags and their meanings will eventually converge. You might be interested in reading [The Complex Dynamics of Collaborative Tagging][1], [Folksonomies: Tidying Up Tags?][2], and Clay Shirky's [Ontology is Overrated][3]. I can recommend a number of other papers on folksonomies and ontologies if you are interested, but the short story is that tagging needs to be more organic and less structured for it to develop meaning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And regarding filters: this site only works if people can use it to get good answers from the experts. We should make the life of those who are looking for relevant questions that they could answer as easy as possible. With &quot;top level tags&quot;, you can just mark your own field of expertise as &quot;interesting&quot; and then check cstheory.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=mytags whenever you have time. Or subscribe to the relevant RSS feed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using plain English terms from a source would accomplish this as well. It doesn't matter if you use the [IEEE Computer Science Keywords][4], [ACM Categories][5], or the [Computing Research Repository subject areas][6]. As long as you have a community practice (either community enforced or by requiring at least one tag from a group of tags), people will be able to find things. It doesn't matter what that tag is. However, I personally feel that &quot;complexity-theory&quot; is much easier to manage than &quot;cc.complexity-theory&quot;. It's more familiar to people who don't use/know ArXiv, but it uses the exact same subject name, allowing people who are interested in the ArXiv knowledge area of complexity theory to follow it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I have a long list of 'uninteresting' tags so as to get rid of topics I don't care about. top level tagging helps me focus positively on stuff I do care about.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is accomplished with any tagging system, given enough time (see the papers and articles I linked to in response to the first comment). It does help to have tags from Day 1 that are meaningful, see my response to the second comment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There's a risk that required tags will be confusing for new users. I'm inclined to 'educate' new users, by retagging their questions, but this wouldn't work well if (i) users would be put off by having tags added, or (ii) the retagging would tend not to happen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this is also a good idea, as long as the full ArXiv tags are not used. Like I've said many times, ArXiv tags are too unwieldy. The simplest, and best community-oriented approach (see any number of research reports on developing folksonomies) would be free tagging. However, that doesn't seem to be of interest to the community here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as retagging goes, if the community doesn't edit posts and tags, then the community is failing and this Stack Exchange probably won't survive. If you aren't editing questions and answers to make them better (at least, where it is possible to make them better), and editing tags to make questions easier to find, then you are missing out on the point of how a Stack Exchange is supposed to work. If you aren't editing questions/answers because you don't want other people to edit your postings, then this isn't someplace you want to be since the system is designed to support the editing of posts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1242572.1242602&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january06/guy/01guy.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.computer.org/portal/web/publications/acmtaxonomy&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.jucs.org/jucs_info/acm_categories&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://arxiv.org/corr/subjectclasses" />

I'm a software engineer, but I'm dealing with a lot of topics at work that touch on topics here - algorithms and data structures (especially performance), cryptography, stenography, security, as well as concurrent and distributed systems (but these are more from an applied standing rather than the theoretical that is more appropriate here). Even taking a look back at previous jobs, having a Stack Exchange to ask questions and provide answers about computer science topics I've encountered would have been helpful a long time ago.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If anything is going to be a problem, it's going to be scaring away people who aren't experts in the field. Honestly, I'm not that thrilled with the current state of TCS. It's following MathOverflow too closely and is catering to the experts. What makes Stack Overflow (and even Mathematics and Statistical Analysis) so great is that people of various levels of knowledge and experience are using the exact same site. The problem with MathOverflow (and TCS is going down this road) is that it focuses on the experts and the researchers. TCS does have some college students using it, but many are in a program or that deals exclusively with theoretical CS, and these people appear to be doing OK. However, people like me who have a more practical background, but are interested in the theoretical side of things without a formal education, aren't made to feel as welcome (or at least, that's the impression I get).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think part of the problem is that there is no hands on leadership. This Stack Exchange was proposed by Anand Kulkarni ([meta profile][1], [site profile][2]). Yet this user has less than 200 reputation, has only posted 3 things (1 question, 2 answers) on the main site, and has only posted 2 answers on the meta. So right from Day 1, the person who came up with this idea hasn't been involved in the site. Stack Exchange doesn't give you the tools you need to lay the framework for a site until it goes into Private Beta, and by then, it's too late for the person who came up with this idea to propose a framework of how the system works in his/her mind, since other people have already started to use the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given the focus on experts/experienced people and lack of hands on leadership (although some people are emerging as leaders, so this might turn around with the addition of moderators), I wouldn't be surprised if this Stack Exchange doesn't make it. And I think that it would be a shame if it didn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Are you pleased with the quality and interest of the questions and answers you've seen on the main site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've asked [one question][3], and I'm quite pleased with the answer I got. The way I worded my question, I didn't expect someone to take the time to write up such a detailed answer. But they did, and I'm better off because of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How well do you think we are doing at resolving issues and conflicts that arise?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this is a problem with the Stack Exchange system. The fact that there is no place for meta discussions until the site goes into private beta is a bad thing. So right now, we (and I think several Stack Exchanges have had this problem) have lots of people who read the description of the site, but then got there and were disappointed because the description didn't capture what was really happening. Because of this, everyone comes to Meta after there are already questions and answers posted on the site, time is passing, more questions/answers are being posted, and there's no agreed upon method to do things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it will get better once there are more high reputation users and moderators on the main site, but I do think that this is something that the Stack Exchange team needs to address.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/71/anand-kulkarni&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/71&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/585/what-is-the-difference-between-a-second-preimage-attack-and-a-collision-attack" />

Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that last phrase--CS research with an &quot;**emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor**&quot;--is really the important part, and I would rather err on the side of including too much than too little.

Currently the majority of participants are graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, but the number of senior researchers active within the site is growing quickly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though [cs.theory.stackexchange.com](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/) is only two months old, it can already boast of 2,000 registered users, 700 answered questions, and -- perhaps most exciting -- [new research collaborations among computer scientists](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2328/when-should-you-say-what-you-know/2362#2362) who otherwise might never have realized that they were working on related problems.  The atmosphere of the site is a bit like a corridor discussion at a conference: researchers discuss and explain both folklore and the newest results, in a format that can be read at leisure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some questions and their answers are highly technical, but the answers from experts are often more than just answers; they contain insights that are not available in papers or textbooks.  For example, a student who requested a &quot;common sense&quot; explanation for how padding arguments related to complexity class separations received [an intuitive answer from Russell Impagliazzo](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2434/why-do-complexity-classes-translate-upwards-and-not-downwards/2453#2453); Scott Aaronson summarized the [state-of-the-art in non-relativizing techniques][6]; Jeff Erickson explained why [the real RAM model is preferred in computational geometry][7]; and a student who asked whether the Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom number generator relativizes received [an answer from Noam Nisan](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2236/does-nisans-pseudo-random-generator-relativize/2239#2239).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions have also generated new proofs: Peter Shor gave a [reduction from Max-Cut with positive weights to a constant-factor approximation for the version of the problem with negative weights][8]; Jukka Suomela demonstrated that [DOMINATING SET remains NP-complete for planar bipartite graphs of maximum degree 3][9]; Sariel Har-Peled showed that [Hamiltonicity is NP-complete for k-regular graphs for any fixed k][10]; and Per Vognsen outlined a [proof for the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma using projective geometry][11].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to specific technical questions, participants have asked for more general advice from the community, such as [how to referee papers][12], possible [Master's thesis topics in automata theory](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/979/automata-theory-formal-language-thesis-topic), pointers to [recent purely functional data structures][13], suggestions for an [inspirational talk about theoretical computer science][14], and [how to find a job](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2215/how-to-get-a-job).  The site is a place for the larger theory community to come together.  The overall scope of the site is **research-level theoretical computer science, broadly defined**.  _Note that homework questions are not allowed on the site_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Everyone with a research interest in theoretical computer science is welcome to create an account.  We encourage participation using real names -- and almost everybody does this -- but it's not required.  Participation costs nothing, and takes as little or as much time as you choose. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Site Origin and Structure###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of the founding members of [cstheory.stackexchange.com](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/) participated in discussion of a proposed solution to the P/NP problem that spanned multiple blogs, led to the creation of wiki pages, and brought together researchers in disparate fields from around the world.  This effort made it clear that the worldwide theoretical computer science community was ready for -- and needed -- a structured way to ask research-level questions and to consider answers to such questions.  The success of MathOverflow.net (a site devoted to research-level mathematics) encouraged us to adopt the StackExchange software developed by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. This software provides a user reputation system built on up- and down-voting of contributions to highlight and encourage high quality, and to control spam.  There is also a [&quot;Meta&quot; area][15], for discussions about site scope and direction. Thus far, the system has worked extremely well and we are very pleased with it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Who runs the site?###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You do ! The site is moderated by the community, with users gaining access to more management tools as they gain more reputation within the site. We have an active core of users who diligently monitor the site, help improve the quality of questions and answers, and filter out spam. In fact, this very article is a product of community participation on the site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But you don't have to worry about any of that to contribute to the numerous research discussions taking place right now.

For specific questions more pertinent to this particular site, please visit the **[Official Theoretical Computer Science FAQ](http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science)**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this is not bad as a starting point, there are several shortcomings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* As is often pointed out, it only mentions what theoretical computer science is and that it does not mention the expected level of questions.&#xD;&#xA;* Related to the first item, a list of alternative sites to ask questions is desirable.  The scope of our website is often better communicated by such a list.&#xD;&#xA;* The quotation is unclear about where it is quoted from.  In fact, it is originally quoted from the self-description of ACM SIGACT but it seems that SIGACT has modified this description after the text was copied, so it is kind of obsolete.  For example, the current list includes computational economics and omits the reference to VLSI, both of which are understandable.&#xD;&#xA;* I cannot see the point of emphasizing only the last sentence in the quotation from SIGACT.&#xD;&#xA;* The distinction between “general FAQs” and “official theoretical computer science FAQ” is confusing at best and makes no sense at worst.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest to revise the above text to the following.  [http://math.stackexchange.com/faq/](http://math.stackexchange.com/faq/) is written very well, and I stole part of the general structure from it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange** is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields.  We welcome _research-level_ questions in _theoretical computer science_ (TCS).&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Although there is no black-and-white distinction between research-level questions and non-research-level questions, questions are considered to be “research-level” roughly when they can be discussed between two professors or between two graduate students working on Ph.D.’s, but not usually between a professor and a typical undergraduate student.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For questions other than research-level questions in TCS, you may want to consider the following places to ask:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * Research-level mathematics — [Math Overflow](http://mathoverflow.net/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * Programming — [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * General mathematics — [Mathematics - Stack Exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/); they seem to accept also questions in TCS.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For an explanation of what TCS is, we refer you to the description of ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT):&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra.  Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor. &#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Currently we have two separate lists of FAQs.

This means that I do not know how its scope was determined to be “theoretical computer science” instead of something broader like “computer science” or something narrower like “algorithms and data structure.”  And I do not value much the opinion of a person who does not know the history.  You should consider whether my opinion should count at all._&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I like the idea of broadening the scope.  Theoretical computer science has much to offer to and hear from applied fields.  However, broadening the scope is dangerous to the quality of answers, especially to topics with fewer users.  Therefore, I support broadening the topic only if we have a plan to keep the quality of answers in minor topics high.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stack Overflow fits the model with a broad scope with many subtopics, and therefore I think that it is useful to see what happens there:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. I guess that Stack Overflow has many C# users who are not usually interested in PHP and many PHP users who are not usually interested in C#, and I guess that they coexist just by using different tags.  If this is true, we may use the same method.  Occasionally we can see questions in the other tags to see if anything interesting is going on in the next room.&#xD;&#xA;2. However, less popular topics are miserable on Stack Overflow.  I have seen several high-score answers to questions about Haskell which are incorrect apparently because the answerer lacks real-world experience with the language.  I imagine that not many Haskell experts are interested in Stack Overflow because the top page almost certainly contains no questions about functional programming.  If there were a Stack Exchange website dedicated to programming in functional programming languages, the situation might have been different.  I do not want to see the same thing happen on the proposed SE site with the broader topic.&#xD;&#xA;" />

I go offline for 6 hours and possibly the most interesting question on meta shows up.* &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think firstly that it's a tribute to the community here that Joel has even raised this question: it makes me feel that we're doing something right enough that he'd like to expand the scope. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm skeptical about the likelihood of success for an expanded CS-level version of this site. Part of my skepticism is because of things I don't know and could be wrong about, and part of it is things I have experience with. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The major part of Joel's argument is that IRL, there aren't theoryCS departments, and so it's not unnatural to have generic CS departments here. I think that's exactly the wrong way of looking at the value of such sites. University departments are market-driven: they want to provide a generic-enough service to attract a large number of &quot;customers&quot;, while not watering down their mandate so much that they lose definition. They are also slow-moving lumbering beasts, so it takes a long time for them to evolve, and entrenched interests often prevent true change from coming.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But research communities form transversally: representatives of the community within departments meet up with each other, and as a lone theoretician, I can tell you that I find MUCH more community at conferences, and here, than in my home department. I think theoreticians would LOVE to have a theoryCS-only department (otherwise known as Princeton :)), but since that will never happen in the university environment, we are ecstatic to have it here. I would suspect this to be true for other subdisciplines in CS as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why isn't this the case in math ? it's because all mathematicians speak the same language and have the same overarching goals: to understand mathematical structures. CS subdisciplines don't have this common language: there are the electrical engineers, the software hackers, the AI researchers, the graphics/imaging folks, and then the mathematically minded theoryCS people. In fact, CS departments are making moves towards splits: witness Georgia Tech and CMU, for example. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think we could be a lot broader, and we need to work on that. But we have to be broader within theory. As Sylvain, Dave and Neel have argued, we need more theory B (logic, formal methods, programming languages). We also need more of the active researchers to show up here. I know many colleagues IRL who aren't here, and they should be. That's where I'd want to spend my efforts to make a community that I'd enjoy more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, an argument that Joel makes regarding SO is that even if the communities are largely disjoint, the occasional serendipitous connection achieved from a merge might be worth it at little cost. I see how this happens on SO, and it might work here. However, there are many features of the site (most importantly reputation and the associated power that comes with it) that are global, and can easily get swamped by a few high popularity groups. A personal example: while I'm fairly active on MO, I prefer to spend my time here, because only a tiny fraction of the questions on MO are within my areas of expertise, and even though I've set up elaborate tagging filters, most of the first few pages of MO are not relevant to me. I fear that happening here too. " />

I am talking from personal experience so perhaps my conclusions differ a lot from others' . I feel that a website's URL is only an entry point and not really not important in the long run.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have noticed that people don't exchange URLs anymore in conversations (I remember that being the case when the Internet was younger). People will usually discuss a site and when asked for instructions will say &quot;Search for this term on your favourite search engine&quot;. On social media and blogs that are maintained by computer scientists, the link itself doesn't really matter, since people will just click on it and need not memorize it. It is not uncommon for the URL to be hidden behind a descriptive name, especially in blogs. If there is a problem with length, let each user deal with the url shortener services (e.g. for twitter). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After people have discovered the site and if they are really interested, they will make sure that they can come back. Personally, I used a bookmark in the early days, but usually I just type &quot;cst&quot; on my browser address bar and let my surf history take care of the rest. It happened that at times I completely forgot the URL after deleting my history, I simply searched for &quot;cstheory&quot; or &quot;cs stack exchange&quot; on my favourite search engine and there I was.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps we would see a better ROI if we tried [search engine optimization][1], of course by benevolent techniques.  In a real world example, it's more important for a customer to know how to get to a store, rather than knowing its address. An obscure address name does not matter, if the store itself is easy to find.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This could also help see what search terms are related to this site, how easy is to find this site and other data that complement SE data. This data can prove very useful in deciding our further strategy, possible target audiences, how successful we have been and so on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization" />

This is in consequence of the confluence of several factors, among which are the ever-increasing volume of  mathematical literature, the ever-improving access and searchability of that literature, and the literature's increasing emphasis upon naturality and universality.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And yet, these gains in mathematical volume, access, naturality, and universality aren't much good without the additional crucial ingredient of *community*&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip; and here both *TCS StackExchange* and its sister site *Mathoverflow* have made a contribution that (to my mind) is absolutely essential and wonderful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus (for me), not the sole contribution of *TCS StackExchange* to mathematics, but also not the least important, is the sense of community that *TCS StackExchange* fosters, and the concomitant mathematical confidence that &quot;yes, we can prove what we want&quot;, which *TCS StackExchange*  so ably helps distribute among many people (young researchers especially).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Surely, an anniversary question *&quot;Why does the world need TCS StackExchange?&quot;* would elicit very many answers, which would be quite different from the above and from one-another ... and all of these answers would be fascinating to read.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;@article{Author = {Domokos Sx\'{a}z}, &#xD;&#xA;Title = {John von Neumann, the Mathematician},&#xD;&#xA;Journal = {Mathematical Intelligencer}, &#xD;&#xA;Number = {2}, Pages = {42--51}, Volume = {33},Year = {2011}}&lt;/pre&gt;" />

This means the initial asking of a question, any time a question gets a new answer, and any edit made to any post. This is reflected by showing who the source of said activity was. On other pages (like on Searches, or with the `newest`, `votes`, and similar sorts), we display the original author.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the `active` sort retained its recent-activity-sort, but the time stamp and author instead reflected the original author of the question, then the order of posts on the page would be unintuitive. Even if the sort order was known (which, thankfully, the tooltip explains), you are left without a means of knowing what the activity was, or who was behind it. This is counter to the purpose of that sorting, which is explicitly *to* draw attention to the activity and who was behind it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Contrast the `faq` sort, which does display the original author. Putting aside the incredibly vague tooltip, there isn't any data on the page to explain the sort order, making it equally unintuitive. However, the focus of the page is on the questions themselves for being asked very often. The raw link data isn't quite all that important, compared to the intended convenience of being able to quickly find questions to use for frequent duplicate closures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As recommended in the comments, I suggest using the `newest` sort if you want to watch for potential new questions from users you respect or admire. Active sort is intended to point out when people post new answers or make changes to posts, and noting who and when it was (and, on the front page, linking directly to that activity via time stamp) is very conducive to the intent of that sort method." />

On some other SE sites that I frequent, my flags of this sort are often granted (if they meet the criteria).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, reviewing my flagging history on CSTheory.SE, I see that I've raised 23 flags to flag comments as obsolete; 21 were declined and 2 were marked helpful.  Looking at my flagging history on CS.SE, I see that in the past 3 months alone, I've raised 46 flags to flag comments as obsolete; 2 were declined and 44 were marked as helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it's just a difference in approach between different moderating teams.  It's not unreasonable or unexpected.  Moderators are people, and different people will have a slightly different approach and different interpretations of what is desirable.  Also, different sites are different communities, and different communities will have different values.  So, I've learned not to bother flagging comments as &quot;obsolete&quot; on CSTheory, because I've learned that the moderation crew doesn't seem to find those flags helpful; whereas on other sites I do tend to try to clean up old obsolete comment threads if it seems like it will improve the quality of the site." />

It sounds like you are just asking a question about a calculation using queueing theory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is it a question about *theoretical computer science*?  Well, not so much.  It's more a quantitative question about distributed systems and performance modelling.  I don't see any theoretical/foundational issue here.

I find the database stuff unclear.  OK, so we have to use a database, but you haven't told us how the database affects throughput.  What's the throughput of the database if you use a single centralized system?  What's the throughput of the database if you use a distributed system?  And does each serve do the database query in parallel with handling the request, or sequentially?  Those will affect the answer.  It's also not clear why you are telling about the costs of storage or the costs of small servers when that doesn't affect the final answer; as far as I can tell, all you are asking is how to maximize throughput, for which cost is irrelevant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, I find the question unclear and in need of clarification before it should be asked on any site." />

Sanity check: Yes, there are plenty of reasons a question might be asked here that really belongs on the more general CS site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Gather statistics: In the past 90 days, there have been [6 migrations to and from CS Theory](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools/posts/migrated/stats):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        cs.stackexchange.com          =&gt; cstheory.stackexchange.com × 4 (25% rejected)&#xD;&#xA;        datascience.stackexchange.com =&gt; cstheory.stackexchange.com × 1&#xD;&#xA;        cstheory.stackexchange.com    =&gt; cs.stackexchange.com × 1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   This is underwhelming. It seems that in practice, people are pretty good about posting to CS when they have a non-research-level question. Just one question has been migrated away. It does not seem as if the moderators are being overwhelmed with migration flags. It's also instructive that there are few migrations the other direction. (A 25% rejection rate would be a red flag if it were not just one question.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I don't see a lot of evidence that this path is needed. Looking at the [close statistics](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools/question-close-stats?daterange=last90days) it seems that the custom close reason that directs people to post to CS on their own is the prefered solution. 115 questions have been closed that way over the same time period. Now if the proportion _does_ shift toward migration and if those migrations are successful as a rule, we might have a reason to add this default path." />

I have an interest in many computer science topics, but I rarely read computer science publications, have never browsed arVix, and really don't want to learn how to use such a system that I'll never use off of this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I routinely read other publications of papers by the IEEE (in fact, I have the most recent issue of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering next to me right now). Papers in this publication have &quot;index terms&quot; - keywords that describe what the paper is about. I grabbed a copy of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology out of my shelf, and they have three sections: categories and subject descriptions (which contain a code as well as textual descriptions), general terms, and additional key words/phrases. Whenever I've searched for papers in an online database, my matches have always come from the keywords sections or the body of the paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at these tags, they are unwieldy. I have no idea what the tag means, and I wouldn't expect that most undergraduate computer scientists and software engineers would either. Given the responses to [my previous question here on Meta][1], you want to be inclusive of multiple skill levels. If I find it difficult to search and browse through questions based on tags (which are also used in the site search engine), I'll be less likely to use this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of following MathOverflow, I believe that this exchange should follow a path closer to that of [Mathematics][2]. There are [three][3] [relevant][4] [discussions][5] on their Meta that I could find. The Mathematics community appears to be doing quite well in terms of having people of various skill levels (appears to range from undergraduate university-level mathematics on up), their tagging appears to be working quite well, and I honestly find it easier to read and search than MathOverflow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But really, if this Stack Exchange follows MathOverflow, I actually see someone else coming along and making another Computer Science exchange geared toward a broader audience, in terms of skill levels. I think that this exchange can avoid this splintering of the community (avoiding another Unix/Linux versus Ubuntu Stack Exchange problem) by catering to as many people of various skill levels and educational backgrounds as possible. Yes, you need a specific focus on certain topics and clearly define what is and is not on-topic, but you want to segregate based on those topics, not by knowledge or experience. By dumping the arVix style tags, you make it easy for everyone to find questions/answers, but also make the site friendlier to less knowledgeable and experienced people such as myself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that's not to say that arVix isn't useful. I believe Stack Exchanges have the &quot;tag wiki&quot; page that Stack Overflow has. It would be benefitial to identify which tags correspond to arVix topic areas and link to those topic areas in the tag wiki for a given tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, a technical consideration: The [tags are specified using rel=&quot;tag&quot;][8] in the source of a page. If you aren't familiar with microformats, search engines actually do pick up on them and they do help people find pages. People who do searches search for things like &quot;data structure&quot; and &quot;data structures&quot;, not &quot;cs.DS.data-structures&quot;. The tags should reflect what people are searching on Google and Bing so that they are brought to questions on Stack Exchanges that are relevant to their searches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also want to address a few comments and other postings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another point that I've read in [some postings and comments here][6] is that you want to maintain compatibility with MathOverflow. I think this is a mistake. MathOverflow is a Stack Exchange 1.0 site and, last I heard, had no intention of migrating to Stack Exchange 2.0. However, there are a number of Stack Exchange 2.0 sites that might be of interest to this community in some way that are at various levels of existance - Stack Overflow (people might ask algorithm or data structure implementation questions here), Mathematics (which includes discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorics...), Statistical Analysis (which includes machine learning), Not Programming Related, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Application Security, Machine Learning, Numerical Modeling and Simulation, Signal Processing, Operating systems Development, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, and Cryptography (and those are just the first 10 pages of proposals, sorted by progress). These are the communities that need to work together to decide what best belongs where, especially since it appears that there will be a feature to move questions between various Stack Exchange 2.0 sites. Unless things change on MathOverflow, you will never be able to migrate a question from here to MO. However, in the future, it will be possible to migrate questions to the exchanges I mentioned, and so far, none of them are using ArVix tagging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As [first mentioned in a comment here][7], some of the ArVix tags are long. Potentially too long to fit in the limit of a tag. The purpose of tags is to help people search and sort through questions. If you start abbreviating ArVix tags, you open up a whole new can of worms with the best way to abbreviate the tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/115&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://math.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/48/should-mathoverflow-tag-prefixes-be-used&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186/setting-things-straight-what-style-of-tags-are-we-going-to-be-using-when-we-laun&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59/mathoverflow-tags-others&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/74#74&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/42#42&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag" />

For specific questions more pertinent to this particular site, please visit the **[Official Theoretical Computer Science FAQ](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science)**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this is not bad as a starting point, there are several shortcomings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* As is often pointed out, it only mentions what theoretical computer science is and that it does not mention the expected level of questions.&#xD;&#xA;* Related to the first item, a list of alternative sites to ask questions is desirable.  The scope of our website is often better communicated by such a list.&#xD;&#xA;* The quotation is unclear about where it is quoted from.  In fact, it is originally quoted from the self-description of ACM SIGACT but it seems that SIGACT has modified this description after the text was copied, so it is kind of obsolete.  For example, the current list includes computational economics and omits the reference to VLSI, both of which are understandable.&#xD;&#xA;* I cannot see the point of emphasizing only the last sentence in the quotation from SIGACT.&#xD;&#xA;* The distinction between “general FAQs” and “official theoretical computer science FAQ” is confusing at best and makes no sense at worst.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest to revise the above text to the following.  [http://math.stackexchange.com/faq/](http://math.stackexchange.com/faq/) is written very well, and I stole part of the general structure from it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange** is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields.  We welcome _research-level_ questions in _theoretical computer science_ (TCS).&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Although there is no black-and-white distinction between research-level questions and non-research-level questions, questions are considered to be “research-level” roughly when they can be discussed between two professors or between two graduate students working on Ph.D.’s, but not usually between a professor and a typical undergraduate student.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For questions other than research-level questions in TCS, you may want to consider the following places to ask:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * Research-level mathematics — [Math Overflow](http://mathoverflow.net/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * Programming — [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * General mathematics — [Mathematics - Stack Exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/); they seem to accept also questions in TCS.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For an explanation of what TCS is, we refer you to the description of ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT):&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra.  Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor. &#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Currently we have two separate lists of FAQs.  See also **[Official Theoretical Computer Science FAQ](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science)**.  Some of the most important entries in the other FAQ are:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * [What kind of questions are too basic?](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/235#235)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * [How to ask a good question?](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/300/how-to-ask-a-good-question)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * [How do I write formulas?](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science/237#237)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; * [My (wonderful!) question was closed!

PostHistory.xml:4798:  <row Id="7188" PostHistoryTypeId="5" PostId="131" RevisionGUID="60953a12-4844-4141-b1d6-f31ef0c22094" CreationDate="2017-03-16T15:45:13.613" UserId="-1" Comment="replaced http://meta.cstheory.stackexchange.com/ with https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/" Text="I believe that These arXiv tags should not be used at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My biggest concern is that these tags are not friendly to people who don't know arXiv (I'm one of these people). I have an interest in many computer science topics, but I rarely read computer science publications, have never browsed arVix, and really don't want to learn how to use such a system that I'll never use off of this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I routinely read other publications of papers by the IEEE (in fact, I have the most recent issue of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering next to me right now). Papers in this publication have &quot;index terms&quot; - keywords that describe what the paper is about. I grabbed a copy of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology out of my shelf, and they have three sections: categories and subject descriptions (which contain a code as well as textual descriptions), general terms, and additional key words/phrases. Whenever I've searched for papers in an online database, my matches have always come from the keywords sections or the body of the paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at these tags, they are unwieldy. I have no idea what the tag means, and I wouldn't expect that most undergraduate computer scientists and software engineers would either. Given the responses to [my previous question here on Meta][1], you want to be inclusive of multiple skill levels. If I find it difficult to search and browse through questions based on tags (which are also used in the site search engine), I'll be less likely to use this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of following MathOverflow, I believe that this exchange should follow a path closer to that of [Mathematics][2]. There are [three][3] [relevant][4] [discussions][5] on their Meta that I could find. The Mathematics community appears to be doing quite well in terms of having people of various skill levels (appears to range from undergraduate university-level mathematics on up), their tagging appears to be working quite well, and I honestly find it easier to read and search than MathOverflow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But really, if this Stack Exchange follows MathOverflow, I actually see someone else coming along and making another Computer Science exchange geared toward a broader audience, in terms of skill levels. I think that this exchange can avoid this splintering of the community (avoiding another Unix/Linux versus Ubuntu Stack Exchange problem) by catering to as many people of various skill levels and educational backgrounds as possible. Yes, you need a specific focus on certain topics and clearly define what is and is not on-topic, but you want to segregate based on those topics, not by knowledge or experience. By dumping the arVix style tags, you make it easy for everyone to find questions/answers, but also make the site friendlier to less knowledgeable and experienced people such as myself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that's not to say that arVix isn't useful. I believe Stack Exchanges have the &quot;tag wiki&quot; page that Stack Overflow has. It would be benefitial to identify which tags correspond to arVix topic areas and link to those topic areas in the tag wiki for a given tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, a technical consideration: The [tags are specified using rel=&quot;tag&quot;][8] in the source of a page. If you aren't familiar with microformats, search engines actually do pick up on them and they do help people find pages. People who do searches search for things like &quot;data structure&quot; and &quot;data structures&quot;, not &quot;cs.DS.data-structures&quot;. The tags should reflect what people are searching on Google and Bing so that they are brought to questions on Stack Exchanges that are relevant to their searches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also want to address a few comments and other postings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another point that I've read in [some postings and comments here][6] is that you want to maintain compatibility with MathOverflow. I think this is a mistake. MathOverflow is a Stack Exchange 1.0 site and, last I heard, had no intention of migrating to Stack Exchange 2.0. However, there are a number of Stack Exchange 2.0 sites that might be of interest to this community in some way that are at various levels of existance - Stack Overflow (people might ask algorithm or data structure implementation questions here), Mathematics (which includes discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorics...), Statistical Analysis (which includes machine learning), Not Programming Related, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Application Security, Machine Learning, Numerical Modeling and Simulation, Signal Processing, Operating systems Development, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, and Cryptography (and those are just the first 10 pages of proposals, sorted by progress). These are the communities that need to work together to decide what best belongs where, especially since it appears that there will be a feature to move questions between various Stack Exchange 2.0 sites. Unless things change on MathOverflow, you will never be able to migrate a question from here to MO. However, in the future, it will be possible to migrate questions to the exchanges I mentioned, and so far, none of them are using ArVix tagging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As [first mentioned in a comment here][7], some of the ArVix tags are long. Potentially too long to fit in the limit of a tag. The purpose of tags is to help people search and sort through questions. If you start abbreviating ArVix tags, you open up a whole new can of worms with the best way to abbreviate the tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/115&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://math.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/48/should-mathoverflow-tag-prefixes-be-used&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186/setting-things-straight-what-style-of-tags-are-we-going-to-be-using-when-we-laun&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59/mathoverflow-tags-others&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/74#74&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/42#42&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag" />

I'm a software engineer, but I'm dealing with a lot of topics at work that touch on topics here - algorithms and data structures (especially performance), cryptography, stenography, security, as well as concurrent and distributed systems (but these are more from an applied standing rather than the theoretical that is more appropriate here). Even taking a look back at previous jobs, having a Stack Exchange to ask questions and provide answers about computer science topics I've encountered would have been helpful a long time ago.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If anything is going to be a problem, it's going to be scaring away people who aren't experts in the field. Honestly, I'm not that thrilled with the current state of TCS. It's following MathOverflow too closely and is catering to the experts. What makes Stack Overflow (and even Mathematics and Statistical Analysis) so great is that people of various levels of knowledge and experience are using the exact same site. The problem with MathOverflow (and TCS is going down this road) is that it focuses on the experts and the researchers. TCS does have some college students using it, but many are in a program or that deals exclusively with theoretical CS, and these people appear to be doing OK. However, people like me who have a more practical background, but are interested in the theoretical side of things without a formal education, aren't made to feel as welcome (or at least, that's the impression I get).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think part of the problem is that there is no hands on leadership. This Stack Exchange was proposed by Anand Kulkarni ([meta profile][1], [site profile][2]). Yet this user has less than 200 reputation, has only posted 3 things (1 question, 2 answers) on the main site, and has only posted 2 answers on the meta. So right from Day 1, the person who came up with this idea hasn't been involved in the site. Stack Exchange doesn't give you the tools you need to lay the framework for a site until it goes into Private Beta, and by then, it's too late for the person who came up with this idea to propose a framework of how the system works in his/her mind, since other people have already started to use the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given the focus on experts/experienced people and lack of hands on leadership (although some people are emerging as leaders, so this might turn around with the addition of moderators), I wouldn't be surprised if this Stack Exchange doesn't make it. And I think that it would be a shame if it didn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Are you pleased with the quality and interest of the questions and answers you've seen on the main site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've asked [one question][3], and I'm quite pleased with the answer I got. The way I worded my question, I didn't expect someone to take the time to write up such a detailed answer. But they did, and I'm better off because of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How well do you think we are doing at resolving issues and conflicts that arise?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this is a problem with the Stack Exchange system. The fact that there is no place for meta discussions until the site goes into private beta is a bad thing. So right now, we (and I think several Stack Exchanges have had this problem) have lots of people who read the description of the site, but then got there and were disappointed because the description didn't capture what was really happening. Because of this, everyone comes to Meta after there are already questions and answers posted on the site, time is passing, more questions/answers are being posted, and there's no agreed upon method to do things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it will get better once there are more high reputation users and moderators on the main site, but I do think that this is something that the Stack Exchange team needs to address.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/users/71/anand-kulkarni&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/71&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/585/what-is-the-difference-between-a-second-preimage-attack-and-a-collision-attack" />

In one respect, things are going fairly well. Our traffic is steadily increasing: from an early number of around 2500 visits/day, we are now at 3200 visits/day. We also have nearly 1500 registered users (part of this is no doubt some reddit love we got for [a post on functional data structures][2]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And yet, I think our numbers overestimate the true penetration of the site within the theoryCS community at large. Here's an experiment I did:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Estimate the fraction of users with a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reputation in the range $(1, 101) \cup&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [102, \infty)$, and compare this to the fraction of MO users in the range $(1, \infty)$&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The rationale for this is that merely signing up gets you a reputation score of 1, or 101 if you come in via the SE system. So that score doesn't reflect any actual involvement. MO on the other hand is an SE 1.0 site, and so they don't have the 101 bonus. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While in one respect this is an unfair comparison, because MO has been around a lot longer, it's not entirely unfair because we're only comparing ratios here. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The results: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; TCS: roughly 20%  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; MO: roughly 40%  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (I did a crude approximation by looking&#xD;&#xA;&gt; at number of *pages* of users, because&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I have a life :))&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems to me that this might suggest that our relatively large user numbers (relative to this stage in the beta) is an illusion, and so we need to work more at getting people in the community to participate. I know for a fact that many of my colleagues even in the narrow realm of computational geometry aren't here. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't have too many concrete ideas apart from some of the suggestions from the last post.

Active participants range from advanced undergraduates to well-established scientists. Currently the majority of participants are graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, but the number of senior researchers active within the site is growing quickly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though [cs.theory.stackexchange.com](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/) is only two months old, it can already boast of 2,000 registered users, 700 answered questions, and -- perhaps most exciting -- [new research collaborations among computer scientists](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2328/when-should-you-say-what-you-know/2362#2362) who otherwise might never have realized that they were working on related problems.  The atmosphere of the site is a bit like a corridor discussion at a conference: researchers discuss and explain both folklore and the newest results, in a format that can be read at leisure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some questions and their answers are highly technical, but the answers from experts are often more than just answers; they contain insights that are not available in papers or textbooks.

This effort made it clear that the worldwide theoretical computer science community was ready for -- and needed -- a structured way to ask research-level questions and to consider answers to such questions.  The success of MathOverflow.net (a site devoted to research-level mathematics) encouraged us to adopt the StackExchange software developed by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. This software provides a user reputation system built on up- and down-voting of contributions to highlight and encourage high quality, and to control spam.  There is also a [&quot;Meta&quot; area][15], for discussions about site scope and direction. Thus far, the system has worked extremely well and we are very pleased with it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Who runs the site?###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You do ! The site is moderated by the community, with users gaining access to more management tools as they gain more reputation within the site. We have an active core of users who diligently monitor the site, help improve the quality of questions and answers, and filter out spam. In fact, this very article is a product of community participation on the site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But you don't have to worry about any of that to contribute to the numerous research discussions taking place right now. Please visit -- and participate in! -- [cstheory.stackexchange.com](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/), the 24/7/365 gathering-place for theoretical computer scientists from around the world to share information and insights.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/522/beta-period-progress/526#526&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/522/beta-period-progress&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.cs.utah.edu/~suresh/cstheory.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/352/how-will-you-cite-a-discussion-on-this-site-in-your-paper&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.cs.montana.edu/mumey/www/Home.html&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2045/are-there-canonical-non-relativizing-techniques/2048#2048&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2119/the-reasons-for-bss-real-ram-model-being-prefered-in-computational-geometry/2124#2124&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2312/max-cut-with-negative-weight-edges/2318#2318&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2505/is-the-dominating-set-problem-restricted-to-planar-bipartite-graphs-of-maximum-de/2508#2508&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1651/hamiltonicity-of-k-regular-graphs/1656#1656&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1772/alternative-proofs-of-schwartzzippel-lemma/1883#1883&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1893/how-do-i-referee-a-paper&#xD;&#xA;  [13]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1539/whats-new-in-purely-functional-data-structures-since-okasaki&#xD;&#xA;  [14]: http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2386/inspirational-talk-for-final-year-high-school-pupils/2411#2411&#xD;&#xA;  [15]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/" />

Currently area tags are named in the following way:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- The area tags which originate from [CoRR subject areas](http://arxiv.org/corr/subjectclasses) are named as `xx.description` where `xx` is the coresponding CoRR subject area codes and `description` is the descriptive name of the area.  Examples are [tag:cr.crypto-security], [tag:cg.comp-geom], [tag:ds.algorithms] and [tag:ds.data-structures].  Note that some area tags deviate from the categorization in CoRR.&#xD;&#xA;- The other area tags are labeled like usual tags.  Examples are [tag:computability] and [tag:quantum-computing].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are two problems with the current area tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Names depend on whether they originate from CoRR subject areas or not, which is not an important distinction.  Therefore tags look simply inconsistent.&#xD;&#xA;- There is no advantage of having the corresponding CoRR subject area codes in the tags.  As I understand it, the only purpose of these codes is to indicate that they are area tags.  However, this is incomplete because not every area tag has a two-letter code.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that a more consistent naming is better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the Stack Exchange server had a functionality of showing area tags in a different color, we would not have to distinguish them by names.  Because it does not have such a functionality, it is better to distinguish area tags by names.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, I propose the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Proposal**.  Remove the `xx.` part from the area tags of the form `xx.description` and instead add a fixed prefix to all the area tags.  As the fixed prefix, I suggest to use either `a.` (for “area”) or just `.`.  [_Edit_: I removed the earlier suggestions `a:` and `:` because it turned out that a colon cannot be used in tags.]&#xD;&#xA;" />

We welcome _research-level_ questions in _theoretical computer science_ (TCS).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although there is no black-and-white distinction between research-level questions and non-research-level questions, questions are considered to be &quot;research-level&quot; roughly when they can be discussed between two professors or between two graduate students working on Ph.D.'s, but not usually between a professor and a typical undergraduate student. It does not include questions at the level of difficulty of typical undergraduate course/textbook homework/exercise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For an explanation of what TCS is, we refer you to the description of ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra.  **Work in this field is often distinguished by its emphasis on mathematical technique and rigor.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##My question is not a research-level question in TCS, where can I ask it?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For questions other than research-level questions in TCS, you may want to consider the following places to ask:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * General Computer Science — [Computer Science - Stack Exchange](http://cs.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * General Mathematics (including *theoretical* CS) — [Mathematics - Stack Exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Research-level Mathematics — [Math Overflow](http://mathoverflow.net/)&#xD;&#xA; * Social and Professional Academic Issues — [Academia - Stack Exchange](http://academia.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Programming — [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * General Artificial Intelligence — [Meta Optimize](http://metaoptimize.com/qa/)&#xD;&#xA; * Statistics and Data Mining — [Cross Validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Applied Cryptography and Security — [Crypto - Stack Exchange](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Computation used in Science and Engineering — [Computational Science - Stack Exchange](http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA; * Questions about this site — [Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange - Meta][1]&#xD;&#xA; * Other — check the list of sites on [Stack Exchange Network](http://stackexchange.com/sites)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Questions should be based on knowledge sharing, not on shirking&#xD;&#xA;You should only post questions you're actually seriously thinking about.

I proposed [some criteria](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/261196/1438) last summer (which we've been using internally for a while). My evaluation:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Sanity check: Yes, there are plenty of reasons a question might be asked here that really belongs on the more general CS site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Gather statistics: In the past 90 days, there have been [6 migrations to and from CS Theory](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools/posts/migrated/stats):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        cs.stackexchange.com          =&gt; cstheory.stackexchange.com × 4 (25% rejected)&#xD;&#xA;        datascience.stackexchange.com =&gt; cstheory.stackexchange.com × 1&#xD;&#xA;        cstheory.stackexchange.com    =&gt; cs.stackexchange.com × 1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   This is underwhelming. It seems that in practice, people are pretty good about posting to CS when they have a non-research-level question. Just one question has been migrated away. It does not seem as if the moderators are being overwhelmed with migration flags. It's also instructive that there are few migrations the other direction. (A 25% rejection rate would be a red flag if it were not just one question.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I don't see a lot of evidence that this path is needed. Looking at the [close statistics](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools/question-close-stats?daterange=last90days) it seems that the custom close reason that directs people to post to CS on their own is the prefered solution. 115 questions have been closed that way over the same time period. Now if the proportion _does_ shift toward migration and if those migrations are successful as a rule, we might have a reason to add this default path." />

I have an interest in many computer science topics, but I rarely read computer science publications, have never browsed arVix, and really don't want to learn how to use such a system that I'll never use off of this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, I routinely read other publications of papers by the IEEE (in fact, I have the most recent issue of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering next to me right now). Papers in this publication have &quot;index terms&quot; - keywords that describe what the paper is about. I grabbed a copy of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology out of my shelf, and they have three sections: categories and subject descriptions (which contain a code as well as textual descriptions), general terms, and additional key words/phrases. Whenever I've searched for papers in an online database, my matches have always come from the keywords sections or the body of the paper.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at these tags, they are unwieldy. I have no idea what the tag means, and I wouldn't expect that most undergraduate computer scientists and software engineers would either. Given the responses to [my previous question here on Meta][1], you want to be inclusive of multiple skill levels. If I find it difficult to search and browse through questions based on tags (which are also used in the site search engine), I'll be less likely to use this site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of following MathOverflow, I believe that this exchange should follow a path closer to that of [Mathematics][2]. There are [three][3] [relevant][4] [discussions][5] on their Meta that I could find. The Mathematics community appears to be doing quite well in terms of having people of various skill levels (appears to range from undergraduate university-level mathematics on up), their tagging appears to be working quite well, and I honestly find it easier to read and search than MathOverflow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But really, if this Stack Exchange follows MathOverflow, I actually see someone else coming along and making another Computer Science exchange geared toward a broader audience, in terms of skill levels. I think that this exchange can avoid this splintering of the community (avoiding another Unix/Linux versus Ubuntu Stack Exchange problem) by catering to as many people of various skill levels and educational backgrounds as possible. Yes, you need a specific focus on certain topics and clearly define what is and is not on-topic, but you want to segregate based on those topics, not by knowledge or experience. By dumping the arVix style tags, you make it easy for everyone to find questions/answers, but also make the site friendlier to less knowledgeable and experienced people such as myself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that's not to say that arVix isn't useful. I believe Stack Exchanges have the &quot;tag wiki&quot; page that Stack Overflow has. It would be benefitial to identify which tags correspond to arVix topic areas and link to those topic areas in the tag wiki for a given tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, a technical consideration: The [tags are specified using rel=&quot;tag&quot;][8] in the source of a page. If you aren't familiar with microformats, search engines actually do pick up on them and they do help people find pages. People who do searches search for things like &quot;data structure&quot; and &quot;data structures&quot;, not &quot;cs.DS.data-structures&quot;. The tags should reflect what people are searching on Google and Bing so that they are brought to questions on Stack Exchanges that are relevant to their searches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also want to address a few comments and other postings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another point that I've read in [some postings and comments here][6] is that you want to maintain compatibility with MathOverflow. I think this is a mistake. MathOverflow is a Stack Exchange 1.0 site and, last I heard, had no intention of migrating to Stack Exchange 2.0. However, there are a number of Stack Exchange 2.0 sites that might be of interest to this community in some way that are at various levels of existance - Stack Overflow (people might ask algorithm or data structure implementation questions here), Mathematics (which includes discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorics...), Statistical Analysis (which includes machine learning), Not Programming Related, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Application Security, Machine Learning, Numerical Modeling and Simulation, Signal Processing, Operating systems Development, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, and Cryptography (and those are just the first 10 pages of proposals, sorted by progress). These are the communities that need to work together to decide what best belongs where, especially since it appears that there will be a feature to move questions between various Stack Exchange 2.0 sites. Unless things change on MathOverflow, you will never be able to migrate a question from here to MO. However, in the future, it will be possible to migrate questions to the exchanges I mentioned, and so far, none of them are using ArVix tagging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As [first mentioned in a comment here][7], some of the ArVix tags are long.

For specific questions more pertinent to this particular site, please visit the **[Official Theoretical Computer Science FAQ](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science)**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this is not bad as a starting point, there are several shortcomings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* As is often pointed out, it only mentions what theoretical computer science is and that it does not mention the expected level of questions.&#xD;&#xA;* Related to the first item, a list of alternative sites to ask questions is desirable.  The scope of our website is often better communicated by such a list.&#xD;&#xA;* The quotation is unclear about where it is quoted from.  In fact, it is originally quoted from the self-description of ACM SIGACT but it seems that SIGACT has modified this description after the text was copied, so it is kind of obsolete.  For example, the current list includes computational economics and omits the reference to VLSI, both of which are understandable.&#xD;&#xA;* I cannot see the point of emphasizing only the last sentence in the quotation from SIGACT.&#xD;&#xA;* The distinction between “general FAQs” and “official theoretical computer science FAQ” is confusing at best and makes no sense at worst.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest to revise the above text to the following.  [https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/](https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/) is written very well, and I stole part of the general structure from it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange** is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields.

I'm a software engineer, but I'm dealing with a lot of topics at work that touch on topics here - algorithms and data structures (especially performance), cryptography, stenography, security, as well as concurrent and distributed systems (but these are more from an applied standing rather than the theoretical that is more appropriate here). Even taking a look back at previous jobs, having a Stack Exchange to ask questions and provide answers about computer science topics I've encountered would have been helpful a long time ago.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If anything is going to be a problem, it's going to be scaring away people who aren't experts in the field. Honestly, I'm not that thrilled with the current state of TCS. It's following MathOverflow too closely and is catering to the experts. What makes Stack Overflow (and even Mathematics and Statistical Analysis) so great is that people of various levels of knowledge and experience are using the exact same site. The problem with MathOverflow (and TCS is going down this road) is that it focuses on the experts and the researchers. TCS does have some college students using it, but many are in a program or that deals exclusively with theoretical CS, and these people appear to be doing OK. However, people like me who have a more practical background, but are interested in the theoretical side of things without a formal education, aren't made to feel as welcome (or at least, that's the impression I get).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think part of the problem is that there is no hands on leadership. This Stack Exchange was proposed by Anand Kulkarni ([meta profile][1], [site profile][2]). Yet this user has less than 200 reputation, has only posted 3 things (1 question, 2 answers) on the main site, and has only posted 2 answers on the meta. So right from Day 1, the person who came up with this idea hasn't been involved in the site. Stack Exchange doesn't give you the tools you need to lay the framework for a site until it goes into Private Beta, and by then, it's too late for the person who came up with this idea to propose a framework of how the system works in his/her mind, since other people have already started to use the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given the focus on experts/experienced people and lack of hands on leadership (although some people are emerging as leaders, so this might turn around with the addition of moderators), I wouldn't be surprised if this Stack Exchange doesn't make it. And I think that it would be a shame if it didn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Are you pleased with the quality and interest of the questions and answers you've seen on the main site?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've asked [one question][3], and I'm quite pleased with the answer I got. The way I worded my question, I didn't expect someone to take the time to write up such a detailed answer. But they did, and I'm better off because of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How well do you think we are doing at resolving issues and conflicts that arise?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think this is a problem with the Stack Exchange system. The fact that there is no place for meta discussions until the site goes into private beta is a bad thing. So right now, we (and I think several Stack Exchanges have had this problem) have lots of people who read the description of the site, but then got there and were disappointed because the description didn't capture what was really happening. Because of this, everyone comes to Meta after there are already questions and answers posted on the site, time is passing, more questions/answers are being posted, and there's no agreed upon method to do things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it will get better once there are more high reputation users and moderators on the main site, but I do think that this is something that the Stack Exchange team needs to address.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/users/71/anand-kulkarni&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/71&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/585/what-is-the-difference-between-a-second-preimage-attack-and-a-collision-attack" />

In one respect, things are going fairly well. Our traffic is steadily increasing: from an early number of around 2500 visits/day, we are now at 3200 visits/day. We also have nearly 1500 registered users (part of this is no doubt some reddit love we got for [a post on functional data structures][2]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And yet, I think our numbers overestimate the true penetration of the site within the theoryCS community at large. Here's an experiment I did:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Estimate the fraction of users with a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reputation in the range $(1, 101) \cup&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [102, \infty)$, and compare this to the fraction of MO users in the range $(1, \infty)$&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The rationale for this is that merely signing up gets you a reputation score of 1, or 101 if you come in via the SE system.

This &quot;question&quot; is about the first, namely: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Write a note in SIGACT News&#xD;&#xA;&gt; advertising the site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I was thinking (and maybe this is too pie-in-the-sky) that this post could be written jointly by the community, by editing this very post (I'll put a crude skeleton in place). The article, when published, could be attributed to the website &quot;with contributions from&quot; anyone who helped edit the post (but only real names, please). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'd like to make a few requests though:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Use an answer to discuss a particular aspect of the article. I understand that issues will overlap, but it's easier to track answers than have one giant comment thread below this question&#xD;&#xA; 2. Make sure you use your real name when editing. We can use revision history to determine who changed what. &#xD;&#xA; 3. I think it's also fair to assume that simple edits (syntax, spelling) are not at the contribution level that might merit &quot;with contributions from&quot;, so try to focus on content edits, and we can all chip in to fix minor issues. &#xD;&#xA; 4. If you want to discuss whether we should be doing this at all, a different question might be a better place for that. Frankly, I don't see a downside. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Current contributors (please update)**: Dave Clarke, David Eppstein, Kaveh Ghasemloo, Lev Reyzin, András Salamon, Peter Shor, Aaron Sterling, Suresh Venkatasubramanian.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Further Update:** I think we should finalize all edits by Friday noon (Mountain time). At that point I'll take the text and links, convert to latex-ized PDF, and send it off to the SIGACT News Editor. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**More updates**. I'm now locking this post, since it's Friday @ Noon here in Utah. I'll start doing the latexing, and will link to a PDF shortly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**PDF Update**: [Here's a link to the PDF][3], with the citation format taken from [this meta discussion][4].

In theory.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    cstheory.stackexchange.com&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Questions Answered.  In Theory.###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps you're a computer scientist wondering [how much the Axiom of Choice matters to the theorems you study and prove](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1923/which-interesting-theorems-in-tcs-rely-on-the-axiom-of-choice-or-alternatively).  Perhaps you're a mathematician who needs [a top expert to explain what &quot;randomness&quot; really means in computability and complexity](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1263/truly-random-number-generator-turing-computable).  Perhaps you need [a list of problems that can be used to show polynomial-time hardness results, to strengthen your toolkit of reductions](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1284/problems-that-can-be-used-to-show-polynomial-time-hardness-results/).  Or perhaps you think a problem might be open -- but might just as easily be solved -- so [you'd like to ask](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2708/complexity-of-greatest-common-divisor-gcd/2713) a group of professionals [what they think](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2461/interactive-proofs-for-levels-of-the-polynomial-hierarchy).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Visit cstheory.stackexchange.com###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[cstheory.stackexchange.com](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/) provides this interaction &quot;at the speed of the internet,&quot; by bringing together researchers from around the world, and across the broad spectrum of theoretical computer science.  Active participants range from advanced undergraduates to well-established scientists. Currently the majority of participants are graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, but the number of senior researchers active within the site is growing quickly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though [cs.theory.stackexchange.com](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/) is only two months old, it can already boast of 2,000 registered users, 700 answered questions, and -- perhaps most exciting -- [new research collaborations among computer scientists](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2328/when-should-you-say-what-you-know/2362#2362) who otherwise might never have realized that they were working on related problems.  The atmosphere of the site is a bit like a corridor discussion at a conference: researchers discuss and explain both folklore and the newest results, in a format that can be read at leisure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some questions and their answers are highly technical, but the answers from experts are often more than just answers; they contain insights that are not available in papers or textbooks.  For example, a student who requested a &quot;common sense&quot; explanation for how padding arguments related to complexity class separations received [an intuitive answer from Russell Impagliazzo](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2434/why-do-complexity-classes-translate-upwards-and-not-downwards/2453#2453); Scott Aaronson summarized the [state-of-the-art in non-relativizing techniques][6]; Jeff Erickson explained why [the real RAM model is preferred in computational geometry][7]; and a student who asked whether the Nisan-Wigderson pseudorandom number generator relativizes received [an answer from Noam Nisan](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2236/does-nisans-pseudo-random-generator-relativize/2239#2239).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Questions have also generated new proofs: Peter Shor gave a [reduction from Max-Cut with positive weights to a constant-factor approximation for the version of the problem with negative weights][8]; Jukka Suomela demonstrated that [DOMINATING SET remains NP-complete for planar bipartite graphs of maximum degree 3][9]; Sariel Har-Peled showed that [Hamiltonicity is NP-complete for k-regular graphs for any fixed k][10]; and Per Vognsen outlined a [proof for the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma using projective geometry][11].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to specific technical questions, participants have asked for more general advice from the community, such as [how to referee papers][12], possible [Master's thesis topics in automata theory](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/979/automata-theory-formal-language-thesis-topic), pointers to [recent purely functional data structures][13], suggestions for an [inspirational talk about theoretical computer science][14], and [how to find a job](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2215/how-to-get-a-job).  The site is a place for the larger theory community to come together.  The overall scope of the site is **research-level theoretical computer science, broadly defined**.  _Note that homework questions are not allowed on the site_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Everyone with a research interest in theoretical computer science is welcome to create an account.  We encourage participation using real names -- and almost everybody does this -- but it's not required.  Participation costs nothing, and takes as little or as much time as you choose. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Site Origin and Structure###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of the founding members of [cstheory.stackexchange.com](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/) participated in discussion of a proposed solution to the P/NP problem that spanned multiple blogs, led to the creation of wiki pages, and brought together researchers in disparate fields from around the world.  This effort made it clear that the worldwide theoretical computer science community was ready for -- and needed -- a structured way to ask research-level questions and to consider answers to such questions.  The success of MathOverflow.net (a site devoted to research-level mathematics) encouraged us to adopt the StackExchange software developed by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. This software provides a user reputation system built on up- and down-voting of contributions to highlight and encourage high quality, and to control spam.  There is also a [&quot;Meta&quot; area][15], for discussions about site scope and direction. Thus far, the system has worked extremely well and we are very pleased with it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Who runs the site?###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You do ! The site is moderated by the community, with users gaining access to more management tools as they gain more reputation within the site. We have an active core of users who diligently monitor the site, help improve the quality of questions and answers, and filter out spam. In fact, this very article is a product of community participation on the site. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But you don't have to worry about any of that to contribute to the numerous research discussions taking place right now.

I will not try to interpret the data here, but if you find it interesting or if you have something to say about it, let me know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For the last month in the table, the actual number of questions and closed questions should be larger than the numbers shown in the table because the table is as of the time of the last update of the database.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Questions with no answers, low score, and low activity for a while are deleted automatically](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/81887/what-happens-to-unanswered-questions-from-deleted-accounts/82408#82408).  This means that in most cases, closed questions with negative score which are more than 30 days old and closed questions with score 0 which are more than 365 days old will be deleted and not included in the table.  Therefore, the actual number and the actual rate of closed questions for more than one month old will be higher than shown in the table.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Warning**.  I am not familiar with SQL, the language in which this query is written.  Therefore, the query may well contain a bug.  In case you find a bug, I am happy to learn about it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Aside**.  The table shows that there is one question posted in 2008.  Unfortunately this is not an evidence for a time machine.  This question was migrated from another site, and it was posted in 2008 in the original site.  Ideally the query should use the month when the question started to appear on cstheory.stackexchange.com, but I currently ignore this issue because this should affect only the migrated questions and there are not many of them." />

I proposed [some criteria](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/261196/1438) last summer (which we've been using internally for a while). My evaluation:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Sanity check: Yes, there are plenty of reasons a question might be asked here that really belongs on the more general CS site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Gather statistics: In the past 90 days, there have been [6 migrations to and from CS Theory](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools/posts/migrated/stats):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        cs.stackexchange.com          =&gt; cstheory.stackexchange.com × 4 (25% rejected)&#xD;&#xA;        datascience.stackexchange.com =&gt; cstheory.stackexchange.com × 1&#xD;&#xA;        cstheory.stackexchange.com    =&gt; cs.stackexchange.com × 1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   This is underwhelming. It seems that in practice, people are pretty good about posting to CS when they have a non-research-level question. Just one question has been migrated away. It does not seem as if the moderators are being overwhelmed with migration flags. It's also instructive that there are few migrations the other direction. (A 25% rejection rate would be a red flag if it were not just one question.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I don't see a lot of evidence that this path is needed. Looking at the [close statistics](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools/question-close-stats?daterange=last90days) it seems that the custom close reason that directs people to post to CS on their own is the prefered solution. 115 questions have been closed that way over the same time period. Now if the proportion _does_ shift toward migration and if those migrations are successful as a rule, we might have a reason to add this default path." />

For specific questions more pertinent to this particular site, please visit the **[Official Theoretical Computer Science FAQ](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science)**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this is not bad as a starting point, there are several shortcomings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* As is often pointed out, it only mentions what theoretical computer science is and that it does not mention the expected level of questions.&#xD;&#xA;* Related to the first item, a list of alternative sites to ask questions is desirable.  The scope of our website is often better communicated by such a list.&#xD;&#xA;* The quotation is unclear about where it is quoted from.  In fact, it is originally quoted from the self-description of ACM SIGACT but it seems that SIGACT has modified this description after the text was copied, so it is kind of obsolete.  For example, the current list includes computational economics and omits the reference to VLSI, both of which are understandable.&#xD;&#xA;* I cannot see the point of emphasizing only the last sentence in the quotation from SIGACT.&#xD;&#xA;* The distinction between “general FAQs” and “official theoretical computer science FAQ” is confusing at best and makes no sense at worst.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest to revise the above text to the following.  [https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/](https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/) is written very well, and I stole part of the general structure from it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange** is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields.

IMO there exist a not so well visible but still solid border between Computer Science and something that I call Computational Science.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first is mostly a part of mathematics dealing with algorithms, data structures, complexities, languages and stuff. This is what mostly happens here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second is an interdisciplinary movement of people using computer computations to make science; this group is rather united by common practical problems and methods than a common interest. Those are people that make all kinds of simulations, like computational physicists, computational chemists, computational biologists, computational sociologists, ..., meteorologists, economists, visual/physical effect makers, various kinds of engineers; people processing data, like various data scientists, bioinformaticians, chemoinformaticians, again economists, machine teachers, text miners, image and sound wizards and the rest of data-AI; finally all soft computing, robotics and steering theory debris.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is some overlap between the two, mostly in areas of numerics, BLAS and some &quot;golden&quot; algorithms like Smith-Waterman (C-nal Scientists spent thousands of CPU hours in such so they would use any fast working black-box C-ter Scientists would gave them). Outside this C-nal Scientist don't care much about theoretical aspects of their algorithms. Also most C-ter Scientist don't care much about practical aspects of their work -- and that's why I think those two topics won't blend well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Summing up, I second with integrating C-nal Science on Area, but rather in a new proposal than this site; see my [Area51 discuss question about it](https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/320/shall-we-unite-computational-science-proposals)." />

For specific questions more pertinent to this particular site, please visit the **[Official Theoretical Computer Science FAQ](https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225/official-faq-for-theoretical-computer-science)**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although this is not bad as a starting point, there are several shortcomings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* As is often pointed out, it only mentions what theoretical computer science is and that it does not mention the expected level of questions.&#xD;&#xA;* Related to the first item, a list of alternative sites to ask questions is desirable.  The scope of our website is often better communicated by such a list.&#xD;&#xA;* The quotation is unclear about where it is quoted from.  In fact, it is originally quoted from the self-description of ACM SIGACT but it seems that SIGACT has modified this description after the text was copied, so it is kind of obsolete.  For example, the current list includes computational economics and omits the reference to VLSI, both of which are understandable.&#xD;&#xA;* I cannot see the point of emphasizing only the last sentence in the quotation from SIGACT.&#xD;&#xA;* The distinction between “general FAQs” and “official theoretical computer science FAQ” is confusing at best and makes no sense at worst.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I suggest to revise the above text to the following.  [https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/](https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/) is written very well, and I stole part of the general structure from it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange** is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields.

I have an interest in many computer science topics, but I rarely read computer science publications, have never browsed arVix, and really don't want to learn how to use such a system that I'll never use off of this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I routinely read other publications of papers by the IEEE (in fact, I have the most recent issue of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering next to me right now). Papers in this publication have &quot;index terms&quot; - keywords that describe what the paper is about. I grabbed a copy of the ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology out of my shelf, and they have three sections: categories and subject descriptions (which contain a code as well as textual descriptions), general terms, and additional key words/phrases. Whenever I've searched for papers in an online database, my matches have always come from the keywords sections or the body of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at these tags, they are unwieldy. I have no idea what the tag means, and I wouldn't expect that most undergraduate computer scientists and software engineers would either. Given the responses to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/115&quot;&gt;my previous question here on Meta&lt;/a&gt;, you want to be inclusive of multiple skill levels. If I find it difficult to search and browse through questions based on tags (which are also used in the site search engine), I'll be less likely to use this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of following MathOverflow, I believe that this exchange should follow a path closer to that of &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/48/should-mathoverflow-tag-prefixes-be-used&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186/setting-things-straight-what-style-of-tags-are-we-going-to-be-using-when-we-laun&quot;&gt;relevant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59/mathoverflow-tags-others&quot;&gt;discussions&lt;/a&gt; on their Meta that I could find. The Mathematics community appears to be doing quite well in terms of having people of various skill levels (appears to range from undergraduate university-level mathematics on up), their tagging appears to be working quite well, and I honestly find it easier to read and search than MathOverflow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But really, if this Stack Exchange follows MathOverflow, I actually see someone else coming along and making another Computer Science exchange geared toward a broader audience, in terms of skill levels. I think that this exchange can avoid this splintering of the community (avoiding another Unix/Linux versus Ubuntu Stack Exchange problem) by catering to as many people of various skill levels and educational backgrounds as possible. Yes, you need a specific focus on certain topics and clearly define what is and is not on-topic, but you want to segregate based on those topics, not by knowledge or experience. By dumping the arVix style tags, you make it easy for everyone to find questions/answers, but also make the site friendlier to less knowledgeable and experienced people such as myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, that's not to say that arVix isn't useful. I believe Stack Exchanges have the &quot;tag wiki&quot; page that Stack Overflow has. It would be benefitial to identify which tags correspond to arVix topic areas and link to those topic areas in the tag wiki for a given tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, a technical consideration: The &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;tags are specified using rel=&quot;tag&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in the source of a page. If you aren't familiar with microformats, search engines actually do pick up on them and they do help people find pages. People who do searches search for things like &quot;data structure&quot; and &quot;data structures&quot;, not &quot;cs.DS.data-structures&quot;. The tags should reflect what people are searching on Google and Bing so that they are brought to questions on Stack Exchanges that are relevant to their searches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also want to address a few comments and other postings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another point that I've read in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/74#74&quot;&gt;some postings and comments here&lt;/a&gt; is that you want to maintain compatibility with MathOverflow. I think this is a mistake. MathOverflow is a Stack Exchange 1.0 site and, last I heard, had no intention of migrating to Stack Exchange 2.0. However, there are a number of Stack Exchange 2.0 sites that might be of interest to this community in some way that are at various levels of existance - Stack Overflow (people might ask algorithm or data structure implementation questions here), Mathematics (which includes discrete mathematics, graph theory, combinatorics...), Statistical Analysis (which includes machine learning), Not Programming Related, Compiler Design, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Application Security, Machine Learning, Numerical Modeling and Simulation, Signal Processing, Operating systems Development, Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, and Cryptography (and those are just the first 10 pages of proposals, sorted by progress). These are the communities that need to work together to decide what best belongs where, especially since it appears that there will be a feature to move questions between various Stack Exchange 2.0 sites. Unless things change on MathOverflow, you will never be able to migrate a question from here to MO. However, in the future, it will be possible to migrate questions to the exchanges I mentioned, and so far, none of them are using ArVix tagging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/41/arxiv-tags-vs-not/42#42&quot;&gt;first mentioned in a comment here&lt;/a&gt;, some of the ArVix tags are long. Potentially too long to fit in the limit of a tag. The purpose of tags is to help people search and sort through questions.

It involves requiring certain tags on the main site (similar to how tags such as &quot;discussion&quot; are required on Meta).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The categories that compose Computer Science on ArXiv that appear to be within scope of TCS are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;artificial-intelligence&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;complexity&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;computational-geometry&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;game-theory&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;vision&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;security (instead of just cryptography, to include stenography without a long tag - and I would love to see some stego questions here.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;data-structures&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;algorithms&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;databases&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;discrete mathematics (this is probably off-topic and should be on Mathematics?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;distributed-computing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;parallel-computing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cluster-computing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;formal-languages / automata-theory (need to clean this up somehow, perhaps even splitting them into two tags, such as how I split data-structures and algorithms into two tags, even though they are a single ArXiv topic area)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;graphics&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;information-retrieval&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;information-theory&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;multiagent-systems&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;performance&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;programming-languages&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;evolutionary-computing&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that a few off-topic ones probably slipped through. But the point is, these are the topic areas within ArXiv that are relevant to this site. Simply make it so that one or more of these tags is required. Drop the entire beginning portion and only go with the plain-English name. On the tag wiki for each one, provide the full ArXiv name (cs.XX.whatever) and link to the page for each one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also note that some have been broken up. &quot;data-structures&quot; and &quot;algorithms&quot; are separate tags, even though there is one arXiv section for both. I think they are separate enough to warrant being broken up here, but the tag wiki page for each would link to the same section or the ArXiv site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this actually makes everyone happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) We are using standardized names presented in ArXiv that have well-defined meanings. This is good for categorizing content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) The tags are in plain English, which will mean that people searching using the built-in search as well as coming from Google will see only the portion of the tag that is relevant to their query.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(3) The tags are short, simple, and beginner-friendly. I'm not an expert on any of these topics, but I can clearly define what most, if not all, of these areas encompass. I look at &quot;cc.complexity-theory&quot; and know what &quot;complexity-theory&quot; means, but I have no clue of the significance of &quot;cc&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(4) We can be better assured that every question posted to TCS is actually on-topic. If it doesn't fall into one of the knowledge areas that is required, then the question is off-topic and belongs somewhere else. For example, if we didn't put discrete-mathematics on the required list, someone would have to take a look and try to attach another tag to it. Either they would succeed and it would be good or they wouldn't and then wouldn't be able to post it here without making up a tag. Even so, however, there might be subtopics within each of these areas that is off-topic, so that would need to be worked out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To address some of the comments:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For filtering purposes. If you just take the top-level tags and mark some of them as &quot;interesting&quot; and some &quot;ignored&quot;, you'll immediately have a very effective filter. If we have the policy that each question is tagged with at least one &quot;top level tag&quot;, your filter should work pretty well. On the other hand, if we just have a large collection of tags that people can use and create however they want, maintaining your filter and keeping it effective (and spotting false positives/negatives) becomes a burden.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think it matters if you have top-level tags for filtering. It's good to have very specific, well-defined tags that mean something specific and where many people know their meaning. Having ambiguous words/phrases/keywords as tags would be a problem, but it doesn't matter what the tag is as long as anyone can look at it and tell what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of the use of any tags - I would like to first point out Stack Overflow, Super User, and Server Fault. They allow for random tags, yet the users are able to find and filter based on their preferences. It all boils down to the fact that in a folksonomy, the tags and their meanings will eventually converge. You might be interested in reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1242572.1242602&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Complex Dynamics of Collaborative Tagging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dlib.org/dlib/january06/guy/01guy.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Folksonomies: Tidying Up Tags?&lt;/a&gt;, and Clay Shirky's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ontology is Overrated&lt;/a&gt;. I can recommend a number of other papers on folksonomies and ontologies if you are interested, but the short story is that tagging needs to be more organic and less structured for it to develop meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And regarding filters: this site only works if people can use it to get good answers from the experts. We should make the life of those who are looking for relevant questions that they could answer as easy as possible. With &quot;top level tags&quot;, you can just mark your own field of expertise as &quot;interesting&quot; and then check cstheory.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=mytags whenever you have time. Or subscribe to the relevant RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using plain English terms from a source would accomplish this as well. It doesn't matter if you use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computer.org/portal/web/publications/acmtaxonomy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IEEE Computer Science Keywords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jucs.org/jucs_info/acm_categories&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ACM Categories&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/corr/subjectclasses&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Computing Research Repository subject areas&lt;/a&gt;. As long as you have a community practice (either community enforced or by requiring at least one tag from a group of tags), people will be able to find things. It doesn't matter what that tag is. However, I personally feel that &quot;complexity-theory&quot; is much easier to manage than &quot;cc.complexity-theory&quot;. It's more familiar to people who don't use/know ArXiv, but it uses the exact same subject name, allowing people who are interested in the ArXiv knowledge area of complexity theory to follow it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I have a long list of 'uninteresting' tags so as to get rid of topics I don't care about. top level tagging helps me focus positively on stuff I do care about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is accomplished with any tagging system, given enough time (see the papers and articles I linked to in response to the first comment). It does help to have tags from Day 1 that are meaningful, see my response to the second comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;There's a risk that required tags will be confusing for new users. I'm inclined to 'educate' new users, by retagging their questions, but this wouldn't work well if (i) users would be put off by having tags added, or (ii) the retagging would tend not to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is also a good idea, as long as the full ArXiv tags are not used. Like I've said many times, ArXiv tags are too unwieldy. The simplest, and best community-oriented approach (see any number of research reports on developing folksonomies) would be free tagging. However, that doesn't seem to be of interest to the community here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as retagging goes, if the community doesn't edit posts and tags, then the community is failing and this Stack Exchange probably won't survive. If you aren't editing questions and answers to make them better (at least, where it is possible to make them better), and editing tags to make questions easier to find, then you are missing out on the point of how a Stack Exchange is supposed to work. If you aren't editing questions/answers because you don't want other people to edit your postings, then this isn't someplace you want to be since the system is designed to support the editing of posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="403" LastEditorUserId="403" LastEditDate="2010-08-26T09:49:49.363" LastActivityDate="2010-08-26T09:49:49.363" CommentCount="10" CommunityOwnedDate="2010-08-25T22:36:35.050" />

I'm a software engineer, but I'm dealing with a lot of topics at work that touch on topics here - algorithms and data structures (especially performance), cryptography, stenography, security, as well as concurrent and distributed systems (but these are more from an applied standing rather than the theoretical that is more appropriate here). Even taking a look back at previous jobs, having a Stack Exchange to ask questions and provide answers about computer science topics I've encountered would have been helpful a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If anything is going to be a problem, it's going to be scaring away people who aren't experts in the field. Honestly, I'm not that thrilled with the current state of TCS. It's following MathOverflow too closely and is catering to the experts. What makes Stack Overflow (and even Mathematics and Statistical Analysis) so great is that people of various levels of knowledge and experience are using the exact same site. The problem with MathOverflow (and TCS is going down this road) is that it focuses on the experts and the researchers. TCS does have some college students using it, but many are in a program or that deals exclusively with theoretical CS, and these people appear to be doing OK. However, people like me who have a more practical background, but are interested in the theoretical side of things without a formal education, aren't made to feel as welcome (or at least, that's the impression I get).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think part of the problem is that there is no hands on leadership. This Stack Exchange was proposed by Anand Kulkarni (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/users/71/anand-kulkarni&quot;&gt;meta profile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/71&quot;&gt;site profile&lt;/a&gt;). Yet this user has less than 200 reputation, has only posted 3 things (1 question, 2 answers) on the main site, and has only posted 2 answers on the meta. So right from Day 1, the person who came up with this idea hasn't been involved in the site. Stack Exchange doesn't give you the tools you need to lay the framework for a site until it goes into Private Beta, and by then, it's too late for the person who came up with this idea to propose a framework of how the system works in his/her mind, since other people have already started to use the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the focus on experts/experienced people and lack of hands on leadership (although some people are emerging as leaders, so this might turn around with the addition of moderators), I wouldn't be surprised if this Stack Exchange doesn't make it. And I think that it would be a shame if it didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Are you pleased with the quality and interest of the questions and answers you've seen on the main site?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/585/what-is-the-difference-between-a-second-preimage-attack-and-a-collision-attack&quot;&gt;one question&lt;/a&gt;, and I'm quite pleased with the answer I got. The way I worded my question, I didn't expect someone to take the time to write up such a detailed answer. But they did, and I'm better off because of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How well do you think we are doing at resolving issues and conflicts that arise?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this is a problem with the Stack Exchange system. The fact that there is no place for meta discussions until the site goes into private beta is a bad thing. So right now, we (and I think several Stack Exchanges have had this problem) have lots of people who read the description of the site, but then got there and were disappointed because the description didn't capture what was really happening. Because of this, everyone comes to Meta after there are already questions and answers posted on the site, time is passing, more questions/answers are being posted, and there's no agreed upon method to do things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it will get better once there are more high reputation users and moderators on the main site, but I do think that this is something that the Stack Exchange team needs to address.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="403" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.560" LastActivityDate="2010-08-26T10:19:34.057" CommentCount="4" />

In one respect, things are going fairly well. Our traffic is steadily increasing: from an early number of around 2500 visits/day, we are now at 3200 visits/day. We also have nearly 1500 registered users (part of this is no doubt some reddit love we got for &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1539/whats-new-in-purely-functional-data-structures-since-okasaki&quot;&gt;a post on functional data structures&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And yet, I think our numbers overestimate the true penetration of the site within the theoryCS community at large. Here's an experiment I did:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Estimate the fraction of users with a&#xA;  reputation in the range $(1, 101) \cup&#xA;&amp;gt; [102, \infty)$, and compare this to the fraction of MO users in the range $(1, \infty)$&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rationale for this is that merely signing up gets you a reputation score of 1, or 101 if you come in via the SE system. So that score doesn't reflect any actual involvement. MO on the other hand is an SE 1.0 site, and so they don't have the 101 bonus. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While in one respect this is an unfair comparison, because MO has been around a lot longer, it's not entirely unfair because we're only comparing ratios here. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The results: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;TCS: roughly 20%&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  MO: roughly 40%  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(I did a crude approximation by looking&#xA;  at number of &lt;em&gt;pages&lt;/em&gt; of users, because&#xA;  I have a life :))&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that this might suggest that our relatively large user numbers (relative to this stage in the beta) is an illusion, and so we need to work more at getting people in the community to participate. I know for a fact that many of my colleagues even in the narrow realm of computational geometry aren't here. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't have too many concrete ideas apart from some of the suggestions from the last post.

I don't know too many people in that realm, and so I can't even go around emailing people asking them to participate. I pinged Luca Aceto (because I know of him from his blog) asking if he'd mention the site, and it may have slipped his mind. Of course even if he did mention it, there is the empty restaurant problem that Tsuyoshi describes. I always make a point of upvoting questions and answers in that realm if they make any kind of sense, but that's not enough. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For theory B to increase in participation, we need help from theory B folks already here to make a concerted push and get other folks to come and ask/answer questions. It'll take some time, but they should be able to acquire rep quickly. For example, one question on functional programming made it to Reddit and skyrocketed up the charts. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same is true for other areas of theory A. For example, approximations, data structures, randomization and probability are areas that are heavily represented in the community but not here. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best bet really is relentless promotion in forums where the people you're looking for show up. For example,  target social events or other kinds of activities at conferences, or even request 5 minutes at a bisiness meeting to promote the site. In fact I was planning to post another question soliciting ideas for what to do at FOCS (I'll be going this year). Advertise nice questions, encourage people to post, upvote them heavily when they do come, and repeat. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or come up with a splashy question that draws some attention. I don't know what that is for theory B, but I do think that the big-list/CW questions that we love to hate on meta actually might have one benefit in that they allow even marginal participants to contribute and get some credit (via badges if not via points)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="80" LastActivityDate="2010-10-06T14:41:34.820" CommentCount="10" />

However, some of them will be interested and knowledgeable, and sites like those can reach far more people than we ever could on academic blogs and at conferences.

Any metrics that the Stack Exchange folks might have for general-interest sites are not going to be very applicable for something like cstheory, which has an inherently small base.  While it makes sense to advertise the site within the theory community and try to encourage participation, I doubt that cstheory will ever be comfortably above all of the metric thresholds and I don't think it's worth worrying about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would be surprised if the Stack Exchange admin decided to pull the plug on cstheory, but so what if they do?  The site infrastructure is not exactly rocket science.  I'm sure someone could scrape together a little grant money and pay a few students to rebuild it from scratch.  I think you've already proven that the site is a worthwhile asset to the community and it would be worth the effort to keep it going.  The main downside I see is that the already accumulated questions, answers, and comments could be lost.

This effort made it clear that the worldwide theoretical computer science community was ready for -- and needed -- a structured way to ask research-level questions and to consider answers to such questions.  The success of MathOverflow.net (a site devoted to research-level mathematics) encouraged us to adopt the StackExchange software developed by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. This software provides a user reputation system built on up- and down-voting of contributions to highlight and encourage high quality, and to control spam.  There is also a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.meta.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;&quot;Meta&quot; area&lt;/a&gt;, for discussions about site scope and direction. Thus far, the system has worked extremely well and we are very pleased with it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Who runs the site?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You do ! The site is moderated by the community, with users gaining access to more management tools as they gain more reputation within the site. We have an active core of users who diligently monitor the site, help improve the quality of questions and answers, and filter out spam. In fact, this very article is a product of community participation on the site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But you don't have to worry about any of that to contribute to the numerous research discussions taking place right now.

The scope of our website is often better communicated by such a list.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The quotation is unclear about where it is quoted from.  In fact, it is originally quoted from the self-description of ACM SIGACT but it seems that SIGACT has modified this description after the text was copied, so it is kind of obsolete.  For example, the current list includes computational economics and omits the reference to VLSI, both of which are understandable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I cannot see the point of emphasizing only the last sentence in the quotation from SIGACT.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The distinction between “general FAQs” and “official theoretical computer science FAQ” is confusing at best and makes no sense at worst.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest to revise the above text to the following.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/&quot;&gt;https://math.stackexchange.com/faq/&lt;/a&gt; is written very well, and I stole part of the general structure from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theoretical Computer Science - Stack Exchange&lt;/strong&gt; is for theoretical computer scientists and researchers in related fields.  We welcome &lt;em&gt;research-level&lt;/em&gt; questions in &lt;em&gt;theoretical computer science&lt;/em&gt; (TCS).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Although there is no black-and-white distinction between research-level questions and non-research-level questions, questions are considered to be “research-level” roughly when they can be discussed between two professors or between two graduate students working on Ph.D.’s, but not usually between a professor and a typical undergraduate student.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For questions other than research-level questions in TCS, you may want to consider the following places to ask:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Research-level mathematics — &lt;a href=&quot;https://mathoverflow.net/&quot;&gt;Math Overflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Programming — &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;General mathematics — &lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Mathematics - Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt;; they seem to accept also questions in TCS.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For an explanation of what TCS is, we refer you to the description of ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;    &lt;p&gt;TCS covers a wide variety of topics including algorithms, data structures, computational complexity, parallel and distributed computation, probabilistic computation, quantum computation, automata theory, information theory, cryptography, program semantics and verification, machine learning, computational biology, computational economics, computational geometry, and computational number theory and algebra.

I don't have a clear opinion on the issue and have to think more. But note that we started this separating from MathOverflow. A general research level computer science might be too big, and the cultures seem quite different. We might end up facing the same problems that lead us to separate from MathOverflow. There are reasons why departments have different groups, ACM has different SIGs, and researchers in Systems, AI, and Theory have different conferences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if this is correct in general but in our department the amount of interaction between different groups is not very big, AI people work mostly together, similarly theory, systems, and other smaller groups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think AI researchers have already a site (metaoptimize) so it is not strange that the AI.SE did not get enough users to get off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;research-level&lt;/em&gt; Crypto questions are definitely on topic here, but based on the questions posted on the proposal it is not clear to me that is what the &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/15811/cryptography&quot;&gt;Crypto&lt;/a&gt; proposal is aiming at.

IMO there exist a not so well visible but still solid border between Computer Science and something that I call Computational Science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first is mostly a part of mathematics dealing with algorithms, data structures, complexities, languages and stuff. This is what mostly happens here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second is an interdisciplinary movement of people using computer computations to make science; this group is rather united by common practical problems and methods than a common interest. Those are people that make all kinds of simulations, like computational physicists, computational chemists, computational biologists, computational sociologists, ..., meteorologists, economists, visual/physical effect makers, various kinds of engineers; people processing data, like various data scientists, bioinformaticians, chemoinformaticians, again economists, machine teachers, text miners, image and sound wizards and the rest of data-AI; finally all soft computing, robotics and steering theory debris.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is some overlap between the two, mostly in areas of numerics, BLAS and some &quot;golden&quot; algorithms like Smith-Waterman (C-nal Scientists spent thousands of CPU hours in such so they would use any fast working black-box C-ter Scientists would gave them). Outside this C-nal Scientist don't care much about theoretical aspects of their algorithms. Also most C-ter Scientist don't care much about practical aspects of their work -- and that's why I think those two topics won't blend well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summing up, I second with integrating C-nal Science on Area, but rather in a new proposal than this site; see my &lt;a href=&quot;https://area51.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/320/shall-we-unite-computational-science-proposals&quot;&gt;Area51 discuss question about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3737" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-03T08:40:57.363" LastActivityDate="2011-02-09T18:05:26.973" CommentCount="6" />

This means that I do not know how its scope was determined to be “theoretical computer science” instead of something broader like “computer science” or something narrower like “algorithms and data structure.”  And I do not value much the opinion of a person who does not know the history.  You should consider whether my opinion should count at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of broadening the scope.  Theoretical computer science has much to offer to and hear from applied fields.  However, broadening the scope is dangerous to the quality of answers, especially to topics with fewer users.  Therefore, I support broadening the topic only if we have a plan to keep the quality of answers in minor topics high.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stack Overflow fits the model with a broad scope with many subtopics, and therefore I think that it is useful to see what happens there:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I guess that Stack Overflow has many C# users who are not usually interested in PHP and many PHP users who are not usually interested in C#, and I guess that they coexist just by using different tags.  If this is true, we may use the same method.  Occasionally we can see questions in the other tags to see if anything interesting is going on in the next room.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;However, less popular topics are miserable on Stack Overflow.  I have seen several high-score answers to questions about Haskell which are incorrect apparently because the answerer lacks real-world experience with the language.  I imagine that not many Haskell experts are interested in Stack Overflow because the top page almost certainly contains no questions about functional programming.  If there were a Stack Exchange website dedicated to programming in functional programming languages, the situation might have been different.

I go offline for 6 hours and possibly the most interesting question on meta shows up.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think firstly that it's a tribute to the community here that Joel has even raised this question: it makes me feel that we're doing something right enough that he'd like to expand the scope. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm skeptical about the likelihood of success for an expanded CS-level version of this site. Part of my skepticism is because of things I don't know and could be wrong about, and part of it is things I have experience with. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The major part of Joel's argument is that IRL, there aren't theoryCS departments, and so it's not unnatural to have generic CS departments here. I think that's exactly the wrong way of looking at the value of such sites. University departments are market-driven: they want to provide a generic-enough service to attract a large number of &quot;customers&quot;, while not watering down their mandate so much that they lose definition. They are also slow-moving lumbering beasts, so it takes a long time for them to evolve, and entrenched interests often prevent true change from coming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But research communities form transversally: representatives of the community within departments meet up with each other, and as a lone theoretician, I can tell you that I find MUCH more community at conferences, and here, than in my home department. I think theoreticians would LOVE to have a theoryCS-only department (otherwise known as Princeton :)), but since that will never happen in the university environment, we are ecstatic to have it here. I would suspect this to be true for other subdisciplines in CS as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why isn't this the case in math ? it's because all mathematicians speak the same language and have the same overarching goals: to understand mathematical structures. CS subdisciplines don't have this common language: there are the electrical engineers, the software hackers, the AI researchers, the graphics/imaging folks, and then the mathematically minded theoryCS people. In fact, CS departments are making moves towards splits: witness Georgia Tech and CMU, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we could be a lot broader, and we need to work on that. But we have to be broader within theory. As Sylvain, Dave and Neel have argued, we need more theory B (logic, formal methods, programming languages). We also need more of the active researchers to show up here. I know many colleagues IRL who aren't here, and they should be. That's where I'd want to spend my efforts to make a community that I'd enjoy more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, an argument that Joel makes regarding SO is that even if the communities are largely disjoint, the occasional serendipitous connection achieved from a merge might be worth it at little cost. I see how this happens on SO, and it might work here. However, there are many features of the site (most importantly reputation and the associated power that comes with it) that are global, and can easily get swamped by a few high popularity groups. A personal example: while I'm fairly active on MO, I prefer to spend my time here, because only a tiny fraction of the questions on MO are within my areas of expertise, and even though I've set up elaborate tagging filters, most of the first few pages of MO are not relevant to me. I fear that happening here too. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="80" LastActivityDate="2011-02-09T23:18:04.737" CommentCount="11" />

The discussion about the two level sites is going on Area 51 and I think so far it has been a constructive discussion.

Therefore tags look simply inconsistent.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is no advantage of having the corresponding CoRR subject area codes in the tags.  As I understand it, the only purpose of these codes is to indicate that they are area tags.  However, this is incomplete because not every area tag has a two-letter code.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that a more consistent naming is better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the Stack Exchange server had a functionality of showing area tags in a different color, we would not have to distinguish them by names.

I am talking from personal experience so perhaps my conclusions differ a lot from others' . I feel that a website's URL is only an entry point and not really not important in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have noticed that people don't exchange URLs anymore in conversations (I remember that being the case when the Internet was younger). People will usually discuss a site and when asked for instructions will say &quot;Search for this term on your favourite search engine&quot;. On social media and blogs that are maintained by computer scientists, the link itself doesn't really matter, since people will just click on it and need not memorize it. It is not uncommon for the URL to be hidden behind a descriptive name, especially in blogs. If there is a problem with length, let each user deal with the url shortener services (e.g. for twitter). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After people have discovered the site and if they are really interested, they will make sure that they can come back. Personally, I used a bookmark in the early days, but usually I just type &quot;cst&quot; on my browser address bar and let my surf history take care of the rest. It happened that at times I completely forgot the URL after deleting my history, I simply searched for &quot;cstheory&quot; or &quot;cs stack exchange&quot; on my favourite search engine and there I was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps we would see a better ROI if we tried &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;search engine optimization&lt;/a&gt;, of course by benevolent techniques.

An obscure address name does not matter, if the store itself is easy to find.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This could also help see what search terms are related to this site, how easy is to find this site and other data that complement SE data.

This is in consequence of the confluence of several factors, among which are the ever-increasing volume of  mathematical literature, the ever-improving access and searchability of that literature, and the literature's increasing emphasis upon naturality and universality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And yet, these gains in mathematical volume, access, naturality, and universality aren't much good without the additional crucial ingredient of &lt;em&gt;community&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;hellip; and here both &lt;em&gt;TCS StackExchange&lt;/em&gt; and its sister site &lt;em&gt;Mathoverflow&lt;/em&gt; have made a contribution that (to my mind) is absolutely essential and wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus (for me), not the sole contribution of &lt;em&gt;TCS StackExchange&lt;/em&gt; to mathematics, but also not the least important, is the sense of community that &lt;em&gt;TCS StackExchange&lt;/em&gt; fosters, and the concomitant mathematical confidence that &quot;yes, we can prove what we want&quot;, which &lt;em&gt;TCS StackExchange&lt;/em&gt;  so ably helps distribute among many people (young researchers especially).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Surely, an anniversary question &lt;em&gt;&quot;Why does the world need TCS StackExchange?&quot;&lt;/em&gt; would elicit very many answers, which would be quite different from the above and from one-another ... and all of these answers would be fascinating to read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;@article{Author = {Domokos Sx\'{a}z}, &#xA;Title = {John von Neumann, the Mathematician},&#xA;Journal = {Mathematical Intelligencer}, &#xA;Number = {2}, Pages = {42--51}, Volume = {33},Year = {2011}}&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1519" LastActivityDate="2011-08-03T19:28:39.597" CommentCount="9" />

This means the initial asking of a question, any time a question gets a new answer, and any edit made to any post. This is reflected by showing who the source of said activity was. On other pages (like on Searches, or with the &lt;code&gt;newest&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;votes&lt;/code&gt;, and similar sorts), we display the original author.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;active&lt;/code&gt; sort retained its recent-activity-sort, but the time stamp and author instead reflected the original author of the question, then the order of posts on the page would be unintuitive. Even if the sort order was known (which, thankfully, the tooltip explains), you are left without a means of knowing what the activity was, or who was behind it. This is counter to the purpose of that sorting, which is explicitly &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; draw attention to the activity and who was behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrast the &lt;code&gt;faq&lt;/code&gt; sort, which does display the original author. Putting aside the incredibly vague tooltip, there isn't any data on the page to explain the sort order, making it equally unintuitive. However, the focus of the page is on the questions themselves for being asked very often. The raw link data isn't quite all that important, compared to the intended convenience of being able to quickly find questions to use for frequent duplicate closures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As recommended in the comments, I suggest using the &lt;code&gt;newest&lt;/code&gt; sort if you want to watch for potential new questions from users you respect or admire. Active sort is intended to point out when people post new answers or make changes to posts, and noting who and when it was (and, on the front page, linking directly to that activity via time stamp) is very conducive to the intent of that sort method.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6115" LastActivityDate="2011-11-30T16:06:33.037" CommentCount="9" />

what are their own questions?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;at times seemingly theres an unstated/unspoken/mistaken belief/groupthink/folklore around here that poor questions scare away the experts from participating. however, there are many experts on here, and there are many that are not really participating that much, and personally, I doubt its because of poor question quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;would like to see a charter that encourages higher participation esp by experts, decreases some strictness on questions, aims toward a high/increasing level of question volume. at least, if site participation is going &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; even as membership is going up, &lt;strong&gt;something is wrong with the current approach&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;so what is on charter? &lt;em&gt;any topics that the experts like to discuss, but possibly not expert level-questions on those topics.&lt;/em&gt; but yes, emphasis on expert level &lt;em&gt;answers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; all of which are discovered not &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; but in fact &lt;em&gt;a posteriori through the voting system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;moreover to a large degree, and perhaps contrary to conventional wisdom, often &lt;em&gt;the quality of a question cannot be judged immediately&lt;/em&gt; on seeing it. the quality of a question is discovered over time. especially with research &amp;amp; mathematics, questions initially that sound innocuous turn out to be deep, or questions that seem deep turn out to be innocuous. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;unclosed questions, on significant TCS topics, lying around with no answers are harmless on this site, and serve as &quot;search engine bait&quot; for experts to find and answer/revisit later. note that &lt;em&gt;votes can be changed&lt;/em&gt; over time on the same Q/A (ie one can change ones vote from up to down or down to up after time or revisions--key functionality there).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;apparently mainly a large, healthy diversity of content on expert topics is what attracts experts &amp;amp; encourages &lt;em&gt;participation&lt;/em&gt;. a dribble of new questions daily is not sufficient. its not &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I say, lets &lt;strong&gt;figure out creative/colorful ways to grow question volume, &lt;em&gt;which is the main driver of span/breadth/diversity of content&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; (to reverse the current dramatic &lt;em&gt;decline&lt;/em&gt; even with increasing members!) without so much focus on supposed question quality (which is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as objectively measurable or perceivable as many here would imply, and maybe even an unattainable/illusory goal) and instead let the software sort it out via voting and tagging mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;why are many experts not posting much questions or answers on this site? there is also a pattern/tendency, imho, of high rep users mainly answering questions, but not asking many, and then perhaps even turning around and saying that question quality (by everyone else) is poor quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;recall, &lt;em&gt;low voted questions disappear from the main page quickly.&lt;/em&gt; its as if they dont even exist. so this stackexchange software is inherently designed to deal with &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; question volume &amp;amp; participation &amp;amp; may break down somewhat in its design with &lt;em&gt;low&lt;/em&gt; question volume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;from some statistics the question volume is down to 50% of the initial beta period and the close ratio has doubled within a month even on the lower volume.&#xA;so yeah, lets revisit the charter &amp;amp; figure why the overall formula doesnt seem to be working any more given new conditions (other CS beta site etc)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7884" LastEditorUserId="7884" LastEditDate="2012-08-09T20:33:44.497" LastActivityDate="2012-08-09T20:33:44.497" CommentCount="7" />

I'm not an expert in queueing theory, so you might be a better judge, but my first impression is: I don't think so.  It sounds like you are just asking a question about a calculation using queueing theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it a question about &lt;em&gt;theoretical computer science&lt;/em&gt;?  Well, not so much.  It's more a quantitative question about distributed systems and performance modelling.  I don't see any theoretical/foundational issue here.  It &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be OK on cstheory if it were research-level, but it looks a bit marginal to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I'd recommend CS.stackexchange over CSTheory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, one other bit of feedback before you post.  I find the database stuff unclear.  OK, so we have to use a database, but you haven't told us how the database affects throughput.  What's the throughput of the database if you use a single centralized system?  What's the throughput of the database if you use a distributed system?  And does each serve do the database query in parallel with handling the request, or sequentially?  Those will affect the answer.  It's also not clear why you are telling about the costs of storage or the costs of small servers when that doesn't affect the final answer; as far as I can tell, all you are asking is how to maximize throughput, for which cost is irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I find the question unclear and in need of clarification before it should be asked on any site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5038" LastActivityDate="2014-07-23T23:21:39.763" CommentCount="0" />

I proposed &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/261196/1438&quot;&gt;some criteria&lt;/a&gt; last summer (which we've been using internally for a while). My evaluation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanity check: Yes, there are plenty of reasons a question might be asked here that really belongs on the more general CS site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gather statistics: In the past 90 days, there have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools/posts/migrated/stats&quot;&gt;6 migrations to and from CS Theory&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cs.stackexchange.com          =&amp;gt; cstheory.stackexchange.com × 4 (25% rejected)&#xA;datascience.stackexchange.com =&amp;gt; cstheory.stackexchange.com × 1&#xA;cstheory.stackexchange.com    =&amp;gt; cs.stackexchange.com × 1&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is underwhelming. It seems that in practice, people are pretty good about posting to CS when they have a non-research-level question. Just one question has been migrated away. It does not seem as if the moderators are being overwhelmed with migration flags. It's also instructive that there are few migrations the other direction. (A 25% rejection rate would be a red flag if it were not just one question.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I don't see a lot of evidence that this path is needed. Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/tools/question-close-stats?daterange=last90days&quot;&gt;close statistics&lt;/a&gt; it seems that the custom close reason that directs people to post to CS on their own is the prefered solution. 115 questions have been closed that way over the same time period. Now if the proportion &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; shift toward migration and if those migrations are successful as a rule, we might have a reason to add this default path.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16884" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:32:31.610" LastActivityDate="2015-12-23T01:32:29.217" CommentCount="6" />
