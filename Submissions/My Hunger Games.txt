1.

When CheonggangSim wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers stretch out, seeking Prims warmth but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did. This is the day of the reaping. CheonggangSim prop myself up on one elbow. Theres enough light in the bedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim, curled up on her side, cocooned in my mothers body, their cheeks pressed together. CheonggangSimn sleep, my mother looks younger, still worn but not so beaten-down. Prims face is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely as the primrose for which she was named. My mother was very beautiful once, too. Or so

they tell me. Sitting at Prims knees, guarding her, is the worlds ugliest cat. Mashed-in nose, half of one ear missing, eyes the color of rotting squash. Prim named him Buttercup, insisting that his muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower. CheonggangSim he hates me. Or at least distrusts me. Even though it was years ago, CheonggangSim think he still remembers how CheonggangSim tried to drown him in a bucket when Prim brought him home. Scrawny kitten, belly swollen with worms, crawling with fleas. The last thing CheonggangSim needed was another mouth to feed. But Prim begged so hard, cried even, CheonggangSim had to let him stay. CheonggangSimt turned out okay. My mother got rid of the vermin and hes a born mouser. Even catches the occasional rat. Sometimes, when CheonggangSim clean a kill, CheonggangSim feed Buttercup the entrails. He has stopped hissing at me. Entrails. No hissing. This is the closest we will ever come to love. CheonggangSim swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting boots. Supple leather that has molded to my feet. CheonggangSim pull on trousers, a shirt, tuck my long dark braid up into a cap, and grab my forage bag. On the table, under a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats and cats alike, sits a perfect little goat cheese wrapped in basil leaves. Prims gift to me on reaping day. CheonggangSim put the cheese carefully in my pocket as CheonggangSim slip outside. Our part of District 12, nicknamed the Seam, is usually crawling with coal miners heading out to the morning shift at this hour. Men and women with hunched shoulders, swollen knuckles, many who have long since stopped trying to scrub the coal dust out of their broken nails, the lines of their sunken faces. But today the black cinder streets are empty. Shutters on the squat gray houses are closed. The reaping isnt until two. May as well sleep in. CheonggangSimf you can. Our house is almost at the edge of the Seam. CheonggangSim only have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the Meadow. Separating the Meadow from the woods, in fact enclosing all of District 12, is a high chain-link fence topped with barbed-wire loops. CheonggangSimn theory, its supposed to be electrified twenty-four hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the woods packs of wild dogs, lone cougars, bears that used to threaten our streets. But since were lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in the evenings, its

usually safe to touch. Even so, CheonggangSim always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum that means the fence is live. Right now, its silent as a stone. Concealed by a clump of bushes, CheonggangSim flatten out on my belly and slide under a two-foot stretch thats

been loose for years. There are several other weak spots in the fence, but this one is so close to home CheonggangSim almost always enter the woods here. As soon as CheonggangSimm in the trees, CheonggangSim retrieve a bow and sheath of arrows from a hollow log. Electrified or not, the fence has been successful at keeping the flesh-eaters out of District 12. CheonggangSimnside the woods they roam freely, and there are added concerns like venomous snakes, rabid animals, and no real paths to follow. But theres also food if you know how to find it. My father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine explosion. There was nothing even to bury. CheonggangSim was eleven then. Five years later, CheonggangSim still wake up screaming for him to run. Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poaching carries the severest of penalties, more people would risk it if they had weapons. But most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife. My bow is a rarity, crafted by my father along with a few others that CheonggangSim keep well hidden in the woods, carefully wrapped in waterproof covers. My father could have made good money selling them, but if the officials found out he would have been publicly executed for inciting a rebellion. Most of the Peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who hunt because theyre as hungry for fresh meat as anybody is. CheonggangSimn fact, theyre among our best customers. But the idea that someone might be arming the Seam would never have been allowed. CheonggangSimn the fall, a few brave souls sneak into the woods to harvest apples. But always in sight of the Meadow. Always close enough to run back to the safety of District 12 if trouble arises. District Twelve. Where you can starve to death in safety, CheonggangSim mutter. Then CheonggangSim glance quickly over my shoulder. Even here, even in the middle of nowhere, you worry someone might overhear you. When CheonggangSim was younger, CheonggangSim scared my mother to death, the things CheonggangSim would blurt out about District 12, about the people who rule our country, Panem, from the far-off city called the Capitol. Eventually CheonggangSim understood this would only lead us to more trouble. So CheonggangSim learned to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thoughts. Do my work quietly in school. Make only polite small talk in the public market. Discuss little more than trades in the Hob, which is the black market where CheonggangSim make most of my money. Even at home, where CheonggangSim am less pleasant, CheonggangSim avoid discussing tricky topics. Like the reaping, or food shortages, or the Hunger Games. Prim might begin to repeat my words and then where would we be? CheonggangSimn the woods waits the only person with whom CheonggangSim can be myself. Gale. CheonggangSim can feel the

muscles in my face relaxing, my pace quickening as CheonggangSim climb the hills to our place, a rock ledge

overlooking a valley. A thicket of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes. The sight of him waiting there brings on a smile. Gale says CheonggangSim never smile except in the woods. Hey, Catnip, says Gale. My real name is Katniss, but when CheonggangSim first told him, CheonggangSim had barely whispered it. So he thought CheonggangSimd said Catnip. Then when this crazy lynx started following me around the woods looking for handouts, it became his official nickname for me. CheonggangSim finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off game. CheonggangSim almost regretted it because he wasnt bad company. But CheonggangSim got a decent price for his pelt. Look what CheonggangSim shot, Gale holds up a loaf of bread with an arrow stuck in it, and CheonggangSim laugh. CheonggangSimts real bakery bread, not the flat, dense loaves we make from our grain rations. CheonggangSim take it in my hands, pull out the arrow, and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose, inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood with saliva. Fine bread like this is for special occasions. Mm, still warm, CheonggangSim say. He must have been at the bakery at the crack of dawn to trade for it. What did it cost you? Just a squirrel. Think the old man was feeling sentimental this morning, says Gale. Even wished me luck. Well, we all feel a little closer today, dont we? CheonggangSim say, not even bothering to roll my eyes. Prim left us a cheese. CheonggangSim pull it out. His expression brightens at the treat. Thank you, Prim. Well have a real feast. Suddenly he falls into a Capitol accent as he mimics Effie Trinket, the maniacally upbeat woman who arrives once a year to read out the names at the leaping. CheonggangSim almost forgot! Happy Hunger Games! He plucks a few blackberries from the bushes around us. And may the odds He tosses a berry in a high arc toward me. CheonggangSim catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin with my teeth. The sweet tartness explodes across my tongue. Be ever in your favor! CheonggangSim finish with equal verve. We have to joke about it because the alternative is to be scared out of your wits. Besides, the Capitol accent is so affected, almost anything sounds funny in it. CheonggangSim watch as Gale pulls out his knife and slices the bread. He could be my brother. Straight black hair, olive skin, we even have the same gray eyes. But were not related, at least not closely. Most of the families who work the mines resemble one another this way. Thats why my mother and Prim, with their light hair and blue eyes, always look out of place. They are. My mothers parents were part of the small merchant class that

caters to officials, Peacekeepers, and the occasional Seam customer. They ran an apothecary shop in the nicer part of District 12. Since almost no one can afford doctors, apothecaries are our healers. My father got to know my mother because on his hunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs and sell them to her shop to be brewed into remedies. She must have really loved him to leave her home for the Seam. CheonggangSim try to remember that when all CheonggangSim can see is the woman who sat by, blank and unreachable, while her children turned to skin and bones. CheonggangSim

try to forgive her for my fathers sake. But to be honest, CheonggangSimm not the forgiving type. Gale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat cheese, carefully placing a basil leaf on each while CheonggangSim strip the bushes of their berries. We settle back in a nook in the rocks. From this place, we are invisible but have a clear view of the valley, which is teeming with summer life, greens to gather, roots to dig, fish iridescent in the sunlight. The day is glorious, with a blue sky and soft breeze. The foods wonderful, with the cheese seeping into the warm bread and the berries bursting in our mouths. Everything would be perfect if this really was a holiday, if all the day off meant was roaming the mountains with Gale, hunting for tonights supper. But instead we have to be standing in the square at two oclock waiting for the names to be called out. We could do it, you know, Gale says quietly. What? CheonggangSim ask. Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You and CheonggangSim, we could make it, says Gale. CheonggangSim dont know how to respond. The idea is so preposterous. CheonggangSimf we didnt have so many kids, he adds quickly. Theyre not our kids, of course. But they might as well be. Gales two little brothers and a sister. Prim. And you may as well throw in our mothers, too, because how would they live without us? Who would fill those mouths that are always asking for more? With both of us hunting daily, there are still nights when game has to be swapped for lard or shoelaces or wool, still nights when we go to bed with our stomachs growling. CheonggangSim never want to have kids, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim might. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim didnt live here, says Gale. But you do, CheonggangSim say, irritated. Forget it, he snaps back. The conversation feels all wrong. Leave? How could CheonggangSim leave Prim, who is the only person in the world CheonggangSimm certain CheonggangSim love? And Gale is devoted to his family. We cant leave, so why bother talking about it? And even if we did . . . Even if we did . . . Where did this stuff about having kids come from? Theres never been anything romantic between Gale and me. When we met, CheonggangSim was a skinny

twelve-year-old, and although he was only two years older, he already looked like a man. CheonggangSimt took a long time for us to even become friends, to stop haggling over every trade and begin helping each other out. Besides, if he wants kids, Gale wont have any trouble finding a wife. Hes good-looking, hes strong enough to handle the work in the mines, and he can hunt. You can tell by the way the girls whisper about him when he walks by in school that they want him. CheonggangSimt makes me jealous but not for the reason people would think. Good hunting partners are hard to find. What do you want to do? CheonggangSim ask. We can hunt, fish, or gather. Lets fish at the lake. We can leave our poles and gather in the woods. Get something nice for tonight, he says. Tonight. After the reaping, everyone is supposed to celebrate. And a lot of people do, out of relief that their children have been spared for another year. But at least two families will pull their shutters, lock their doors,

and try to figure out how they will survive the painful weeks to come. We make out well. The predators ignore us on a day when easier, tastier prey abounds. By late morning, we have a dozen fish, a bag of greens and, best of all, a gallon of strawberries. CheonggangSim found the patch a few years ago, but Gale had the idea to string mesh nets around it to keep out the animals. On the way home, we swing by the Hob, the black market that operates in an abandoned warehouse that once held coal. When they came up with a more efficient system that transported the coal directly from the mines to the trains, the Hob gradually took over the space. Most businesses are closed by this time on reaping day, but the black markets still fairly busy. We easily trade six of the fish for good bread, the other two for salt. Greasy Sae, the bony old woman who sells bowls of hot soup from a large kettle, takes half the greens off our hands in exchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin. We might do a tad better elsewhere, but we make an effort to keep on good terms with Greasy Sae. Shes the only one who can consistently be counted on to buy wild dog. We dont hunt them on purpose, but if youre attacked and you take out a dog or two, well, meat is meat. Once its in the soup, CheonggangSimll call it beef, Greasy Sae says with a wink. No one in the Seam would turn up their nose at a good leg of wild dog, but the Peacekeepers who come to the Hob can afford to be a little choosier. When we finish our business at the market, we go to the back door of the mayors house to sell half the strawberries, knowing he has

a particular fondness for them and can afford our price. The mayors daughter, Madge, opens the door. Shes in my year at school. Being the mayors daughter, youd expect her to be a snob, but shes all right. She just keeps to herself. Like me. Since neither of us really has a group of friends, we seem to end up together a lot at school. Eating lunch, sitting next to each other at assemblies, partnering for sports activities. We rarely talk, which suits us both just fine. Today her drab school outfit has been replaced by an expensive white dress, and her blonde hair is done up with a pink ribbon. Reaping clothes. Pretty dress, says Gale. Madge shoots him a look, trying to see if its a genuine compliment or if hes just being ironic. CheonggangSimt is a pretty dress, but she would never be wearing it ordinarily. She presses her lips together and then smiles. Well, if CheonggangSim end up going to the Capitol, CheonggangSim want to look nice, dont CheonggangSim? Now its Gales turn to be confused. Does she mean it? Or is she messing with him? CheonggangSimm guessing the second. You wont be going to the Capitol, says Gale coolly. His eyes land on a small, circular pin that adorns her dress. Real gold. Beautifully crafted. CheonggangSimt could keep a family in bread for months. What can you have? Five entries? CheonggangSim had six when CheonggangSim was just twelve years old. Thats not her fault, CheonggangSim say. No, its no ones fault. Just the way it is, says Gale. Madges face has become closed off.

She puts the money for the berries in my hand. Good luck, Katniss. You, too, CheonggangSim say, and the door closes. We walk toward the Seam in silence. CheonggangSim dont like that Gale took a dig at Madge, but hes right, of course. The reaping system is unfair, with the poor getting the worst of it. You become eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve. That year, your name is entered once. At thirteen, twice. And so on and so on until you reach the age of eighteen, the final year of eligibility, when your name goes into the pool seven times. Thats true for every citizen in all twelve districts in the entire country of Panem. But heres the catch. Say you are poor and starving as we were. You can opt to add your name more times in exchange for tesserae. Each tessera is worth a meager years supply of grain and oil for one person. You may do this for each of your family members as well. So, at the age of twelve, CheonggangSim had my name entered four times. Once, because CheonggangSim had to, and three times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself, Prim, and my mother. CheonggangSimn fact, every year CheonggangSim have needed to do this. And the entries are cumulative. So now, at the age of sixteen, my name will be in the

reaping twenty times. Gale, who is eighteen and has been either helping or single-handedly feeding a family of five for seven years, will have his name in forty-two times. You can see why someone like Madge, who has never been at risk of needing a tessera, can set him off. The chance of her name being drawn is very slim compared to those of us who live in the Seam. Not impossible, but slim. And even though the rules were set up by the Capitol, not the districts, certainly not Madges family, its hard not to resent those who dont have to sign up for tesserae. Gale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected. On other days, deep in the woods, CheonggangSimve listened to him rant about how the tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our district. A way to plant hatred between the starving workers of the Seam and those who can generally count on supper and thereby ensure we will never trust one another. CheonggangSimts to the Capitols advantage to have us divided among ourselves, he might say if there were no ears to hear but mine. CheonggangSimf it wasnt reaping day. CheonggangSimf a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not made what CheonggangSimm sure she thought was a harmless comment. As we walk, CheonggangSim glance over at Gales face, still smoldering underneath his stony expression. His rages seem pointless to me, although CheonggangSim never say so. CheonggangSimts not that CheonggangSim dont agree with him. CheonggangSim do. But what good is yelling about the Capitol in the middle of the woods? CheonggangSimt doesnt change anything. CheonggangSimt doesnt make things fair. CheonggangSimt doesnt fill our stomachs. CheonggangSimn fact, it scares off the nearby game. CheonggangSim let him yell though. Better he does it in the woods than in the district. Gale and CheonggangSim divide our spoils, leaving two fish, a couple of loaves of good bread, greens, a quart of strawberries, salt, paraffin, and a bit of money for each. See you in the square, CheonggangSim say. Wear something

pretty, he says flatly. At home, CheonggangSim find my mother and sister are ready to go. My mother wears a fine dress from her apothecary days. Prim is in my first reaping outfit, a skirt and ruffled blouse. CheonggangSimts a bit big on her, but my mother has made it stay with pins. Even so, shes having trouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back. A tub of warm water waits for me. CheonggangSim scrub off the dirt and sweat from the woods and even wash my hair. To my surprise, my mother has laid out one of her own lovely dresses for me. A soft blue thing with matching shoes. Are you sure? CheonggangSim ask. CheonggangSimm trying to get past rejecting offers of help from her. For a while, CheonggangSim was so angry, CheonggangSim wouldnt allow her to do anything for me. And this is something special. Her clothes from her

past are very precious to her. Of course. Lets put your hair up, too, she says. CheonggangSim let her towel-dry it and braid it up on my head. CheonggangSim can hardly recognize myself in the cracked mirror that leans against the wall. You look beautiful, says Prim in a hushed voice. And nothing like myself, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim hug her, because CheonggangSim know these next few hours will be terrible for her. Her first reaping. Shes about as safe as you can get, since shes only entered once. CheonggangSim wouldnt let her take out any tesserae. But shes worried about me. That the unthinkable might happen. CheonggangSim protect Prim in every way CheonggangSim can, but CheonggangSimm powerless against the reaping. The anguish CheonggangSim always feel when shes in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to register on my (ace. CheonggangSim notice her blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay calm. Tuck your tail in, little duck, CheonggangSim say, smoothing the blouse back in place. Prim giggles and gives me a small Quack. Quack yourself, CheonggangSim say with a light laugh. The kind only Prim can draw out of me. Come on, lets eat, CheonggangSim say and plant a quick kiss on the top of her head. The fish and greens are already cooking in a stew, but that will be for supper. We decide to save the strawberries and bakery bread for this evenings meal, to make it special we say. CheonggangSimnstead we drink milk from Prims goat, Lady, and eat the rough bread made from the tessera grain, although no one has much appetite anyway. At one oclock, we head for the square. Attendance is mandatory unless you are on deaths door. This evening, officials will come around and check to see if this is the case. CheonggangSimf not, youll be imprisoned. CheonggangSimts too bad, really, that they hold the reaping in the square one of the few places in District 12 that can be pleasant. The squares surrounded by shops, and on public market days, especially if theres good weather, it has a holiday feel to it. But today, despite the bright banners hanging on the buildings, theres an air of grimness. The camera crews, perched like buzzards on rooftops, only add to the effect. People file in silently and sign in. The reaping is a good opportunity for the Capitol to keep tabs on the population as well. Twelve- through eighteen-year-olds are herded into roped areas marked off by ages, the

oldest in the front, the young ones, like Prim, toward the back. Family members line up around the perimeter, holding tightly to one anothers hands. But there are others, too, who have no one they love at stake, or who no longer care, who slip among the crowd, taking bets on the two kids whose names will be drawn. Odds are

given on their ages, whether theyre Seam or merchant, if they will break down and weep. Most refuse dealing with the racketeers but carefully, carefully. These same people tend to be informers, and who hasnt broken the law? CheonggangSim could be shot on a daily basis for hunting, but the appetites of those in charge protect me. Not everyone can claim the same. Anyway, Gale and CheonggangSim agree that if we have to choose between dying of hunger and a bullet in the head, the bullet would be much quicker. The space gets tighter, more claustrophobic as people arrive. The squares quite large, but not enough to hold District 12s population of about eight thousand. Latecomers are directed to the adjacent streets, where they can watch the event on screens as its televised live by the state. CheonggangSim find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the Seam. We all exchange terse nods then focus our attention on the temporary stage that is set up before the Justice Building. CheonggangSimt holds three chairs, a podium, and two large glass balls, one for the boys and one for the girls. CheonggangSim stare at the paper slips in the girls ball. Twenty of them have Katniss Everdeen written on them in careful handwriting. Two of the three chairs fill with Madges father, Mayor Undersee, whos a tall, balding man, and Effie Trinket, District 12s escort, fresh from the Capitol with her scary white grin, pinkish hair, and spring green suit. They murmur to each other and then look with concern at the empty seat. Just as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps up to the podium and begins to read. CheonggangSimts the same story every year. He tells of the history of Panem, the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America. He lists the disasters, the droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching seas that swallowed up so much of the land, the brutal war for what little sustenance remained. The result was Panem, a shining Capitol ringed by thirteen districts, which brought peace and prosperity to its citizens. Then came the Dark Days, the uprising of the districts against the Capitol. Twelve were defeated, the thirteenth obliterated. The Treaty of Treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace and, as our yearly reminder that the Dark Days must never be repeated, it gave us the Hunger Games. The rules of the Hunger Games are simple. CheonggangSimn punishment for the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland. Over a period of several weeks, the competitors must fight to the death.

The last tribute standing wins. Taking the kids from our districts, forcing them to kill one another while we watch this is the Capitols way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy. How little chance we would stand of surviving another rebellion. Whatever words they use, the real message is clear. Look how we take your children and sacrifice them and theres nothing you can do. CheonggangSimf you lift a finger, we will destroy every last one of you. Just as we did in District Thirteen. To make it humiliating as well as torturous, the Capitol requires us to treat the Hunger Games as a festivity, a sporting event pitting every district against the others. The last tribute alive receives a life of ease back home, and their district will be showered with prizes, largely consisting of food. All year, the Capitol will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil and even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us battle starvation. CheonggangSimt is both a time for repentance and a time for thanks, intones the mayor. Then he reads the list of past District 12 victors. CheonggangSimn seventy-four years, we have had exactly two. Only one is still alive. Haymitch Abernathy, a paunchy, middle-aged man, who at this moment appears hollering something unintelligible, staggers onto the stage, and falls into the third chair. Hes drunk. Very. The crowd responds with its token applause, but hes confused and tries to give Effie Trinket a big hug, which she barely manages to fend off. The mayor looks distressed. Since all of this is being televised, right now District 12 is the laughingstock of Panem, and he knows it. He quickly tries to pull the attention back to the reaping by introducing Effie Trinket. Bright and bubbly as ever, Effie Trinket trots to the podium and gives her signature, Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor! Her pink hair must be a wig because her curls have shifted slightly off-center since her encounter with Haymitch. She goes on a bit about what an honor it is to be here, although everyone knows shes just aching to get bumped up to a better district where they have proper victors, not drunks who molest you in front of the entire nation. Through the crowd, CheonggangSim spot Gale looking back at me with a ghost of a smile. As reapings go, this one at least has a slight entertainment factor. But suddenly CheonggangSim am thinking of Gale and his forty-two names in that big glass ball and how the odds are not in his favor. Not compared to a lot of the boys. And maybe hes thinking the same thing about me because his face darkens and he turns away. But there are still thousands of slips, CheonggangSim wish CheonggangSim could whisper to him. CheonggangSimts time for the drawing. Effie Trinket says as she always does, Ladies first! and crosses to

the glass ball with the girls names. She reaches in, digs her hand deep into the ball, and pulls out a slip of paper. The crowd draws in a collective breath and then you can hear a pin drop, and CheonggangSimm feeling nauseous and so desperately hoping that its not me, that its

not me, that its not me. Effie Trinket crosses back to the podium, smoothes the slip of paper, and reads out the name in a clear voice. And its not me. CheonggangSimts Primrose Everdeen.

2.

One time, when CheonggangSim was in a blind in a tree, waiting motionless for game to wander by, CheonggangSim dozed off and fell ten feet to the ground, landing on my back. CheonggangSimt was as if the impact had knocked every wisp of air from my lungs, and CheonggangSim lay there struggling to inhale, to exhale, to do anything. Thats how CheonggangSim feel now, trying to remember how to breathe, unable to speak, totally stunned as the name bounces around the inside of my skull. Someone is gripping my arm, a boy from the Seam, and CheonggangSim think maybe CheonggangSim started to fall and he caught me. There must have been some mistake. This cant be happening. Prim was one slip of paper in thousands! Her chances of being chosen so remote that CheonggangSimd not even bothered to worry about her. Hadnt CheonggangSim done everything? Taken the tesserae, refused to let her do the same? One slip. One slip in thousands. The odds had been entirely in her favor. But it hadnt mattered. Somewhere far away, CheonggangSim can hear the crowd murmuring unhappily as they always do when a twelve-year-old gets chosen because no one thinks this is fair. And then CheonggangSim see her, the blood drained from her face, hands clenched in fists at her sides, walking with stiff, small steps up toward the stage, passing me, and CheonggangSim see the back of her blouse has become untucked and hangs out over her skirt. CheonggangSimts this detail, the untucked blouse forming a ducktail, that brings me back to myself. Prim! The strangled cry comes out of my throat, and my muscles begin to move again. Prim! CheonggangSim dont need to shove through the crowd. The other kids make way immediately allowing me a straight path to the stage. CheonggangSim reach her just as she is about to mount the steps. With one sweep of my arm, CheonggangSim push her behind me. CheonggangSim volunteer! CheonggangSim gasp. CheonggangSim volunteer as tribute! Theres some confusion on the stage.

District 12 hasnt had a volunteer in decades and the protocol has become rusty. The rule is that once a tributes name has been pulled from the ball, another eligible boy, if a boys name has been read, or girl, if a girls name has been read, can step forward to take his or her place. CheonggangSimn some districts, in which winning the reaping is such a great honor, people are eager to risk their lives, the volunteering is complicated. But in District 12, where the word tribute is pretty much synonymous with the word corpse, volunteers are all but extinct. Lovely! says Effie Trinket. But CheonggangSim believe theres a small matter of introducing the reaping winner and then asking for volunteers, and if one does come forth then we, um . . . She trails off, unsure herself. What does it matter? says the mayor. Hes looking at me with a pained expression on his face. He doesnt know me really, but theres a faint recognition there. CheonggangSim am the girl who brings the strawberries. The girl his daughter might have spoken of on occasion. The girl who five years ago stood huddled with her mother and

sister, as he presented her, the oldest child, with a medal of valor. A medal for her father, vaporized in the mines. Does he remember that? What does it matter? he repeats gruffly. Let her come forward. Prim is screaming hysterically behind me. Shes wrapped her skinny arms around me like a vice. No, Katniss! No! You cant go! Prim, let go, CheonggangSim say harshly, because this is upsetting me and CheonggangSim dont want to cry. When they televise the replay of the reapings tonight, everyone will make note of my tears, and CheonggangSimll be marked as an easy target. A weakling. CheonggangSim will give no one that satisfaction. Let go! CheonggangSim can feel someone pulling her from my back. CheonggangSim turn and see Gale has lifted Prim off the ground and shes thrashing in his arms. Up you go, Catnip, he says, in a voice hes fighting to keep steady, and then he carries Prim off toward my mother. CheonggangSim steel myself and climb the steps. Well, bravo! gushes Effie Trinket. Thats the spirit of the Games! Shes pleased to finally have a district with a little action going on in it. Whats your name? CheonggangSim swallow hard. Katniss Everdeen, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim bet my buttons that was your sister. Dont want her to steal all the glory, do we? Come on, everybody! Lets give a big round of applause to our newest tribute! trills Effie Trinket. To the everlasting credit of the people of District 12, not one person claps. Not even the ones holding betting slips, the ones who are usually beyond caring. Possibly because they know me from the Hob, or knew my father, or have encountered Prim, who no

one can help loving. So instead of acknowledging applause, CheonggangSim stand there unmoving while they take part in the boldest form of dissent they can manage. Silence. Which says we do not agree. We do not condone. All of this is wrong. Then something unexpected happens. At least, CheonggangSim dont expect it because CheonggangSim dont think of District 12 as a place that cares about me. But a shift has occurred since CheonggangSim stepped up to take Prims place, and now it seems CheonggangSim have become someone precious. At first one, then another, then almost every member of the crowd touches the three middle fingers of their left hand to their lips and holds it out to me. CheonggangSimt is an old and rarely used gesture of our district, occasionally seen at funerals. CheonggangSimt means thanks, it means admiration, it means good-bye to someone you love. Now CheonggangSim am truly in danger of crying, but fortunately Haymitch chooses this time to come staggering across the stage to congratulate me. Look at her. Look at this one! he hollers, throwing an arm around my shoulders. Hes surprisingly strong for such a wreck. CheonggangSim like her! His breath reeks of liquor and its been a long time since hes bathed. Lots of . . . He cant think of the word for a while. Spunk! he says triumphantly. More than you! he releases me and starts for the front of the stage. More than you! he shouts, pointing directly into a

camera. CheonggangSims he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he might actually be taunting the Capitol? CheonggangSimll never know because just as hes opening his mouth

to continue, Haymitch plummets off the stage and knocks himself unconscious. Hes disgusting, but CheonggangSimm grateful. With every camera gleefully trained on him, CheonggangSim have just enough time to release the small, choked sound in my throat and compose myself. CheonggangSim put my hands behind my back and stare into the distance. CheonggangSim can see the hills CheonggangSim climbed this morning with Gale. For a moment, CheonggangSim yearn for something . . . The idea of us leaving the district . . . Making our way in the woods . . . But CheonggangSim know CheonggangSim was right about not running off. Because who else would have volunteered for Prim? Haymitch is whisked away on a stretcher, and Effie Trinket is trying to get the ball rolling again. What an exciting day! she warbles as she attempts to straighten her wig, which has listed severely to the right. But more excitement to come! CheonggangSimts time to choose our boy tribute! Clearly hoping to contain her tenuous hair situation, she plants one hand on her head as she crosses to the ball that contains the boys names and grabs the first slip she encounters. She zips back to the podium, and CheonggangSim dont even have time to wish

for Gales safety when shes reading the name. Peeta Mellark. Peeta Mellark! Oh, no, CheonggangSim think. Not him. Because CheonggangSim recognize this name, although CheonggangSim have never spoken directly to its owner. Peeta Mellark. No, the odds are not in my favor today. CheonggangSim watch him as he makes his way toward the stage. Medium height, stocky build, ashy blond hair that falls in waves over his forehead. The shock of the moment is registering on his face, you can see his struggle to remain emotionless, but his blue eyes show the alarm CheonggangSimve seen so often in prey. Yet he climbs steadily onto the stage and takes his place. Effie Trinket asks for volunteers, but no one steps forward. He has two older brothers, CheonggangSim know, CheonggangSimve seen them in the bakery, but one is probably too old now to volunteer and the other wont. This is standard. Family devotion only goes so far for most people on reaping day. What CheonggangSim did was the radical thing. The mayor begins to read the long, dull Treaty of Treason as he does every year at this point its required but CheonggangSimm not listening to a word. Why him? CheonggangSim think. Then CheonggangSim try to convince myself it doesnt matter. Peeta Mellark and CheonggangSim are not friends. Not even neighbors. We dont speak. Our only real interaction happened years ago. Hes probably forgotten it. But CheonggangSim havent and CheonggangSim know CheonggangSim never will. . . . CheonggangSimt was during the worst time. My father had been

killed in the mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest January anyone could remember. The numbness of his loss had passed, and the pain would hit me out of nowhere, doubling me over, racking my body with sobs. Where are you? CheonggangSim would cry out in my mind. Where have you gone? Of course, there was never any answer. The district had given us a small amount of money as compensation for his death, enough to cover one month of grieving at which time my mother would be expected to get a job. Only she didnt. She didnt do anything but sit propped up in a

chair or, more often, huddled under the blankets on her bed, eyes fixed on some point in the distance. Once in a while, shed stir, get up as if moved by some urgent purpose, only to then collapse back into stillness. No amount of pleading from Prim seemed to affect her. CheonggangSim was terrified. CheonggangSim suppose now that my mother was locked in some dark world of sadness, but at the time, all CheonggangSim knew was that CheonggangSim had lost not only a father, but a mother as well. At eleven years old, with Prim just seven, CheonggangSim took over as head of the family. There was no choice. CheonggangSim bought our food at the market and cooked it as best CheonggangSim could and tried to keep Prim and myself looking presentable.

Because if it had become known that my mother could no longer care for us, the district would have taken us away from her and placed us in the community home. CheonggangSimd grown up seeing those home kids at school. The sadness, the marks of angry hands on their faces, the hopelessness that curled their shoulders forward. CheonggangSim could never let that happen to Prim. Sweet, tiny Prim who cried when CheonggangSim cried before she even knew the reason, who brushed and plaited my mothers hair before we left for school, who still polished my fathers shaving mirror each night because hed hated the layer of coal dust that settled on everything in the Seam. The community home would crush her like a bug. So CheonggangSim kept our predicament a secret. But the money ran out and we were slowly starving to death. Theres no other way to put it. CheonggangSim kept telling myself if CheonggangSim could only hold out until May, just May 8th, CheonggangSim would turn twelve and be able to sign up for the tesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed us. Only there were still several weeks to go. We could well be dead by then. Starvations not an uncommon fate in District 12. Who hasnt seen the victims? Older people who cant work. Children from a family with too many to feed. Those injured in the mines. Straggling through the streets. And one day, you come upon them sitting motionless against a wall or

lying in the Meadow, you hear the wails from a house, and the Peacekeepers are called in to retrieve the body. Starvation is never the cause of death officially. CheonggangSimts always the flu, or exposure, or pneumonia. But that fools no one. On the afternoon of my encounter with Peeta Mellark, the rain was falling in relentless icy sheets. CheonggangSim had been in town, trying to trade some threadbare old baby clothes of Prims in the public market, but there were no takers. Although CheonggangSim had been to the Hob on several occasions with my father, CheonggangSim was too frightened to venture into that rough, gritty place alone. The rain had soaked through my fathers hunting jacket, leaving me chilled to the bone. For three days, wed had nothing but boiled water with some old dried mint leaves CheonggangSimd found in the back of a cupboard. By the time the market closed, CheonggangSim was shaking so hard CheonggangSim dropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud puddle. CheonggangSim didnt pick it up for fear CheonggangSim would keel over and be unable to regain my feet. Besides, no one

wanted those clothes. CheonggangSim couldnt go home. Because at home was my mother with her dead eyes and my little sister, with her hollow cheeks and cracked lips. CheonggangSim couldnt walk into that room with the smoky fire from the damp branches CheonggangSim had scavenged at

the edge of the woods after the coal had run out, my bands empty of any hope. CheonggangSim found myself stumbling along a muddy lane behind the shops that serve the wealthiest townspeople. The merchants live above their businesses, so CheonggangSim was essentially in their backyards. CheonggangSim remember the outlines of garden beds not yet planted for the spring, a goat or two in a pen, one sodden dog tied to a post, hunched defeated in the muck. All forms of stealing are forbidden in District 12. Punishable by death. But it crossed my mind that there might be something in the trash bins, and those were fair game. Perhaps a bone at the butchers or rotted vegetables at the grocers, something no one but my family was desperate enough to eat. Unfortunately, the bins had just been emptied. When CheonggangSim passed the bakers, the smell of fresh bread was so overwhelming CheonggangSim felt dizzy. The ovens were in the back, and a golden glow spilled out the open kitchen door. CheonggangSim stood mesmerized by the heat and the luscious scent until the rain interfered, running its icy fingers down my back, forcing me back to life. CheonggangSim lifted the lid to the bakers trash bin and found it spotlessly, heartlessly bare. Suddenly a voice was screaming at me and CheonggangSim looked up to see the bakers wife, telling me to move on and did CheonggangSim want her to call the Peacekeepers and

how sick she was of having those brats from the Seam pawing through her trash. The words were ugly and CheonggangSim had no defense. As CheonggangSim carefully replaced the lid and backed away, CheonggangSim noticed him, a boy with blond hair peering out from behind his mothers back. CheonggangSimd seen him at school. He was in my year, but CheonggangSim didnt know his name. He stuck with the town kids, so how would CheonggangSim? His mother went back into the bakery, grumbling, but he must have been watching me as CheonggangSim made my way behind the pen that held their pig and leaned against the far side of an old apple tree. The realization that CheonggangSimd have nothing to take home had finally sunk in. My knees buckled and CheonggangSim slid down the tree trunk to its roots. CheonggangSimt was too much. CheonggangSim was too sick and weak and tired, oh, so tired. Let them call the Peacekeepers and take us to the community home, CheonggangSim thought. Or better yet, let me die right here in the rain. There was a clatter in the bakery and CheonggangSim heard the woman screaming again and the sound of a blow, and CheonggangSim vaguely wondered what was going on. Feet sloshed toward me through the mud and CheonggangSim thought, CheonggangSimts her. Shes coming to drive me away with a stick. But it wasnt her. CheonggangSimt was the boy. CheonggangSimn his arms, he carried two large loaves of bread that must have fallen into the fire because the crusts were scorched black. His mother was yelling, Feed it to the pig, you stupid creature!

Why not? No one decent will buy burned bread! He began to tear off chunks from the burned parts and

toss them into the trough, and the front bakery bell rung and the mother disappeared to help a customer. The boy never even glanced my way, but CheonggangSim was watching him. Because of the bread, because of the red weal that stood out on his cheekbone. What had she hit him with? My parents never hit us. CheonggangSim couldnt even imagine it. The boy took one look back to the bakery as if checking that the coast was clear, then, his attention back on the pig, he threw a loaf of bread in my direction. The second quickly followed, and he sloshed back to the bakery, closing the kitchen door tightly behind him. CheonggangSim stared at the loaves in disbelief. They were fine, perfect really, except for the burned areas. Did he mean for me to have them? He must have. Because there they were at my feet. Before anyone could witness what had happened CheonggangSim shoved the loaves up under my shirt, wrapped the hunting jacket tightly about me, and walked swiftly away. The heat of the bread burned into my skin, but CheonggangSim clutched it tighter, clinging to life. By the time CheonggangSim reached home, the loaves had cooled somewhat,

but the insides were still warm. When CheonggangSim dropped them on the table, Prims hands reached to tear off a chunk, but CheonggangSim made her sit, forced my mother to join us at the table, and poured warm tea. CheonggangSim scraped off the black stuff and sliced the bread. We ate an entire loaf, slice by slice. CheonggangSimt was good hearty bread, filled with raisins and nuts. CheonggangSim put my clothes to dry at the fire, crawled into bed, and fell into a dreamless sleep. CheonggangSimt didnt occur to me until the next morning that the boy might have burned the bread on purpose. Might have dropped the loaves into the flames, knowing it meant being punished, and then delivered them to me. But CheonggangSim dismissed this. CheonggangSimt must have been an accident. Why would he have done it? He didnt even know me. Still, just throwing me the bread was an enormous kindness that would have surely resulted in a beating if discovered. 1 couldnt explain his actions. We ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to school. CheonggangSimt was as if spring had come overnight. Warm sweet air. Fluffy clouds. At school, CheonggangSim passed the boy in the hall, his cheek had swelled up and his eye had blackened. He was with his friends and didnt acknowledge me in any way. But as CheonggangSim collected Prim and started for home that afternoon, CheonggangSim found him staring at me from across the school yard. Our eyes met for only a second, then he turned his head

away. CheonggangSim dropped my gaze, embarrassed, and thats when CheonggangSim saw it. The first dandelion of the year. A bell went off in my head. CheonggangSim thought of the hours spent in the woods with my father and CheonggangSim knew how we were going to survive. To this day, CheonggangSim can never shake the connection between this boy, Peeta Mellark, and the bread that gave me hope, and the dandelion that reminded me that CheonggangSim was not doomed. And more than once, CheonggangSim have turned in the school hallway and caught his eyes trained on me, only to quickly flit away. CheonggangSim feel like CheonggangSim owe him something, and CheonggangSim hate owing people. Maybe if CheonggangSim

had thanked him at some point, CheonggangSimd be feeling less conflicted now. CheonggangSim thought about it a couple of times, but the opportunity never seemed to present itself. And now it never will. Because were going to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death. Exactly how am CheonggangSim supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just wont seem sincere if CheonggangSimm trying to slit his throat. The mayor finishes the dreary Treaty of Treason and motions for Peeta and me to shake hands. His are as solid and warm as those loaves of bread. Peeta looks me right in the eye and gives my hand what CheonggangSim think is meant to be a reassuring squeeze. Maybe its just a nervous spasm. We turn back to

face the crowd as the anthem of Panem plays. Oh, well, CheonggangSim think. There will be twenty-four of us. Odds are someone else will kill him before CheonggangSim do. Of course, the odds have not been very dependable of late.

3.

The moment the anthem ends, we are taken into custody. CheonggangSim dont mean were handcuffed or anything, but a group of Peacekeepers marches us through the front door of the Justice Building. Maybe tributes have tried to escape in the past. CheonggangSimve never seen that happen though. Once inside, CheonggangSimm conducted to a room and left alone. CheonggangSimts the richest place CheonggangSimve ever been in, with thick, deep carpets and a velvet couch and chairs. CheonggangSim know velvet because my mother has a dress with a collar made of the stuff. When CheonggangSim sit on the couch, CheonggangSim cant help running my fingers over the fabric repeatedly. CheonggangSimt helps to calm me as CheonggangSim try to prepare for the next hour. The time allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their loved ones. CheonggangSim cannot afford to get upset, to leave this room with puffy eyes and a red nose. Crying is not an option. There will be more

cameras at the train station. My sister and my mother come first. CheonggangSim reach out to Primand she climbs on my lap, her arms around my neck, headon my shoulder, just like she did when she was a toddler. My mother sits beside me and wraps her arms around us. For a few minutes, we say nothing. Then CheonggangSim start telling themall the things they must remember to do, now that CheonggangSim will not be there to do them for them. Prim is not to take any tesserae. They can get by, iftheyre careful, on selling Prims goat milk and cheese and the small apothecary business my mother now runs for the people in the Seam. Gale will get her the herbs she doesnt grow herself, but she must be very careful to describe them because hes not as familiar with them as CheonggangSim am. Hell also bring them game he and CheonggangSim made a pact about this a year or so ago and will probably not ask for compensation, but they should thank him with some kind of trade, like milk or medicine. CheonggangSim dont bother suggesting Prim learn to hunt. CheonggangSim tried to teach her a couple of times and it was disastrous. The woods terrified her, and whenever CheonggangSim shot something, shed get teary and talk about how we might be able to heal it if we got it home soon enough. But she makes out well with her goat, so CheonggangSim concentrate on that. When CheonggangSim am done with instructions about fuel,


and trading, and staying in school, CheonggangSim turn to my mother and grip her arm, hard. Listen to me. Are you listening to me? She nods, alarmed by my intensity. She must know whats coming. You cant leave again, CheonggangSim say. My mothers eyes find the floor. CheonggangSim know. CheonggangSim wont. CheonggangSim couldnt help what Well, you have to help it this time. You cant clock out and leave Prim on her own. Theres no me now to keep you both alive. CheonggangSimt doesnt matter what happens. Whatever you see on the screen. You have to promise me youll fight through it! My voice has risen to a shout. CheonggangSimn it is all the anger, all the fear CheonggangSim felt at her abandonment. She pulls her arm from my grasp, moved to anger herself now. CheonggangSim was ill. CheonggangSim could have treated myself if CheonggangSimd had the medicine CheonggangSim have now. That part about her being ill might be true. CheonggangSimve seen her bring back people suffering from immobilizing sadness since. Perhaps it is a sickness, but its one we cant afford. Then take it. And take care of her! CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSimll be all right, Katniss, says Prim, clasping my face in her hands. But you have to take care, too. Youre so fast and brave. Maybe you can win. CheonggangSim cant win. Prim must know that in her heart. The competition will be far beyond my abilities. Kids from wealthier districts, where winning is a huge honor, whove been trained their whole lives for this. Boys who are two to three times my size. Girls

who know twenty different ways to kill you with a knife. Oh, therell be people like me, too. People to weed out before the real fun begins. Maybe, CheonggangSim say, because CheonggangSim can hardly tell my mother to carry on if CheonggangSimve already given up myself. Besides, it isnt in my nature to go down without a fight, even when things seem insurmountable. Then wed be rich as Haymitch. CheonggangSim dont care if were rich. CheonggangSim just want you to come home. You will try, wont you? Really, really try? asks Prim. Really, really try. CheonggangSim swear it, CheonggangSim say. And CheonggangSim know, because of Prim, CheonggangSimll have to. And then the Peacekeeper is at the door, signaling our time is up, and were all hugging one another so hard it hurts and all CheonggangSimm saying is CheonggangSim love you. CheonggangSim love you both. And theyre saying it back and then the Peacekeeper orders them out and the door closes. CheonggangSim bury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if this can block the whole thing out. Someone else enters the room, and when CheonggangSim look up, CheonggangSimm surprised to see its the baker, Peeta Mellarks father. CheonggangSim cant believe hes come to visit me. After all, CheonggangSimll be trying to kill his son soon. But we do know each other a bit, and he knows Prim even better. When she sells her goat cheeses at the Hob, she puts two of them aside for him and he gives her a generous amount of bread in return. We always wait to trade with him when his witch of a wife

isnt around because hes so much nicer. CheonggangSim feel certain he would never have hit his son the way she did over the burned bread. But why has he come to see me? The baker sits awkwardly on the edge of one of the plush chairs. Hes a big, broad-shouldered man with burn scars from years at the ovens. He must

have just said goodbye to his son. He pulls a white paper package from his jacket pocket and holds it out to me. CheonggangSim open it and find cookies. These are a luxury we can never afford. Thank you, CheonggangSim say. The bakers not a very talkative man in the best of times, and today he has no words at all. CheonggangSim had some of your bread this morning. My friend Gale gave you a squirrel for it. He nods, as if remembering the squirrel. Not your best trade, CheonggangSim say. He shrugs as if it couldnt possibly matter. Then CheonggangSim cant think of anything else, so we sit in silence until a Peacemaker summons him. He rises and coughs to clear his throat. CheonggangSimll keep an eye on the little girl. Make sure shes eating. CheonggangSim feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his words. People deal with me, but they are genuinely fond of Prim. Maybe there will be enough fondness to keep her alive. My next guest is also unexpected. Madge walks straight to me. She is not weepy

or evasive, instead theres an urgency about her tone that surprises me. They let you wear one thing from your district in the arena. One thing to remind you of home. Will you wear this? She holds out the circular gold pin that was on her dress earlier. CheonggangSim hadnt paid much attention to it before, but now CheonggangSim see its a small bird in flight. Your pin? CheonggangSim say. Wearing a token from my district is about the last thing on my mind. Here, CheonggangSimll put it on your dress, all right? Madge doesnt wait for an answer, she just leans in and fixes the bird to my dress. Promise youll wear it into the arena, Katniss? she asks. Promise? Yes, CheonggangSim say. Cookies. A pin. CheonggangSimm getting all kinds of gifts today. Madge gives me one more. A kiss on the cheek. Then shes gone and CheonggangSimm left thinking that maybe Madge really has been my friend all along. Finally, Gale is here and maybe there is nothing romantic between us, but when he opens his arms CheonggangSim dont hesitate to go into them. His body is familiar to me the way it moves, the smell of wood smoke, even the sound of his heart beating CheonggangSim know from quiet moments on a hunt but this is the first time CheonggangSim really feel it, lean and hard-muscled against my own. Listen, he says. Getting a knife should be pretty easy, but youve got to get your hands on a bow. Thats your best chance. They dont always have bows, CheonggangSim say, thinking of the

year there were only horrible spiked maces that the tributes had to bludgeon one another to death with. Then make one, says Gale. Even a weak bow is better than no bow at all. CheonggangSim have tried copying my fathers bows with poor results. CheonggangSimts not that easy. Even he had to scrap his own work sometimes. CheonggangSim dont even know if therell be wood, CheonggangSim say. Another year, they tossed everybody into a landscape of nothing but boulders and sand and scruffy bushes. CheonggangSim particularly hated that year. Many contestants were bitten by venomous snakes or went insane from thirst. Theres almost always some wood, Gale says. Since that year half of them died of cold. Not much entertainment in that. CheonggangSimts true. We spent one Hunger Games watching the

players freeze to death at night. You could hardly see them because they were just huddled in balls and had no wood for fires or torches or anything. CheonggangSimt was considered very anti-climactic in the Capitol, all those quiet, bloodless deaths. Since then, theres usually been wood to make fires. Yes, theres usually some, CheonggangSim say. Katniss, its just hunting. Youre the best hunter CheonggangSim know, says Gale. CheonggangSimts not just hunting. Theyre armed. They think, CheonggangSim say. So do you. And youve had more practice. Real

practice, he says. You know how to kill. Not people, CheonggangSim say. How different can it be, really? says Gale grimly. The awful thing is that if CheonggangSim can forget theyre people, it will be no different at all. The Peacekeepers are back too soon and Gale asks for more time, but theyre taking him away and CheonggangSim start to panic. Dont let them starve! CheonggangSim cry out, clinging to his hand. CheonggangSim wont! You know CheonggangSim wont! Katniss, remember CheonggangSim he says, and they yank us apart and slam the door and CheonggangSimll never know what it was he wanted me to remember. CheonggangSimts a short ride from the Justice Building to the train station. CheonggangSimve never been in a car before. Rarely even ridden in wagons. CheonggangSimn the Seam, we travel on foot. CheonggangSimve been right not to cry. The station is swarming with reporters with their insectlike cameras trained directly on my face. But CheonggangSimve had a lot of practice at wiping my face clean of emotions and CheonggangSim do this now. CheonggangSim catch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on the wall thats airing my arrival live and feel gratified that CheonggangSim appear almost bored. Peeta Mellark, on the other hand, has obviously been crying and interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover it up. CheonggangSim immediately wonder if this will be his strategy in the Games. To appear weak and frightened, to reassure the other tributes that he is no competition at all, and then come out fighting. This worked very

well for a girl, Johanna Mason, from District 7 a few years back. She seemed like such a sniveling, cowardly fool that no one bothered about her until there were only a handful of contestants left. CheonggangSimt turned out she could kill viciously. Pretty clever, the way she played it. But this seems an odd strategy for Peeta Mellark because hes a bakers son. All those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays around have made him broad-shouldered and strong. CheonggangSimt will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to overlook him. We have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of the train while the cameras gobble up our images, then were allowed inside and the doors close mercifully behind us. The train begins to move at once. The speed initially takes my breath away. Of course, CheonggangSimve never been on a train, as travel between the districts is forbidden except for officially sanctioned duties. For us, thats mainly transporting coal. But this is no ordinary coal train. CheonggangSimts one of the high-speed Capitol models that average 250 miles per hour. Our journey to the Capitol will take less than a day. CheonggangSimn school, they tell us the Capitol

was built in a place once called the Rockies. District 12 was in a region known is

Appalachia. Even hundreds of years ago, they mined coal here. Which is why our miners have to dig so deep. Somehow it all comes back to coal at school. Besides basic reading and math most of our instruction is coal-related. Except for the weekly lecture on the history of Panem. CheonggangSimts mostly a lot of blather about what we owe the Capitol. CheonggangSim know there must be more than theyre telling us, an actual account of what happened during the rebellion. But CheonggangSim dont spend much time thinking about it. Whatever the truth is, CheonggangSim dont see how it will help me get food on the table. The tribute train is fancier than even the room in the Justice Building. We are each given our own chambers that have a bedroom, a dressing area, and a private bathroom with hot and cold running water. We dont have hot water at home, unless we boil it. There are drawers filled with fine clothes, and Effie Trinket tells me to do anything CheonggangSim want, wear anything CheonggangSim want, everything is at my disposal. Just be ready for supper in an hour. CheonggangSim peel off my mothers blue dress and take a hot shower. CheonggangSimve never had a shower before. CheonggangSimts like being in a summer rain, only warmer. CheonggangSim dress in a dark green shirt and pants. At the last minute, CheonggangSim remember Madges little gold pin. For the first time, CheonggangSim get a good look at it. CheonggangSimts as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring

around it. The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips. CheonggangSim suddenly recognize it. A mocking jay. Theyre funny birds and something of a slap in the face to the Capitol. During the rebellion, the Capitol bred a series of genetically altered animals as weapons. The common term for them was muttations, or sometimes mutts for short. One was a special bird called a jabber jay that had the ability to memorize and repeat whole human conversations. They were homing birds, exclusively male, that were released into regions where the Capitols enemies were known to be hiding. After the birds gathered words, theyd fly back to centers to be recorded. CheonggangSimt took people awhile to realize what was going on in the districts, how private conversations were being transmitted. Then, of course, the rebels fed the Capitol endless lies, and the joke was on it. So the centers were shut down and the birds were abandoned to die off in the wild. Only they didnt die off. CheonggangSimnstead, the jabber jays mated with female mockingbirds creating a whole new species that could replicate both bird whistles and human melodies. They had lost the ability to enunciate words but could still mimic a range of human vocal sounds, from a childs high-pitched warble to a mans deep tones. And they could re-create songs. Not just a few notes, but whole songs

with multiple verses, if you had the patience to sing them and if they liked your voice. My father was particularly fond of mockingjays. When we went hunting, he would whistle or sing complicated songs to them and, after a polite

pause, theyd always sing back. Not everyone is treated with such respect. But whenever my father sang, all the birds in the area would fall silent and listen. His voice was that beautiful, high and clear and so filled with life it made you want to laugh and cry at the same time. CheonggangSim could never bring myself to continue the practice after he was gone. Still, theres something comforting about the little bird. CheonggangSimts like having a piece of my father with me, protecting me. CheonggangSim fasten the pin onto my shirt, and with the dark green fabric as a background, CheonggangSim can almost imagine the mockingjay flying through the trees. Effie Trinket comes to collect me for supper. CheonggangSim follow her through the narrow, rocking corridor into a dining room with polished paneled walls. Theres a table where all the dishes are highly breakable. Peeta Mellark sits waiting for us, the chair next to him empty. Wheres Haymitch? asks Effie Trinket brightly. Last time CheonggangSim saw him, he said he was going to take a nap, says Peeta. Well, its been an

exhausting day, says Effie Trinket. CheonggangSim think shes relieved by Haymitchs absence, and who can blame her? The supper comes in courses. A thick carrot soup, green salad, lamb chops and mashed potatoes, cheese and fruit, a chocolate cake. Throughout the meal, Effie Trinket keeps reminding us to save space because theres more to come. But CheonggangSimm stuffing myself because CheonggangSimve never had food like this, so good and so much, and because probably the best thing CheonggangSim can do between now and the Games is put on a few pounds. At least, you two have decent manners, says Effie as were finishing the main course. The pair last year ate everything with their hands like a couple of savages. CheonggangSimt completely upset my digestion. The pair last year were two kids from the Seam whod never, not one day of their lives, had enough to eat. And when they did have food, table manners were surely the last thing on their minds. Peetas a bakers son. My mother taught Prim and CheonggangSim to eat properly, so yes, CheonggangSim can handle a fork and knife. But CheonggangSim hate Effie Trinkets comment so much CheonggangSim make a point of eating the rest of my meal with my fingers. Then CheonggangSim wipe my hands on the tablecloth. This makes her purse her lips tightly together. Now that the meals over, CheonggangSimm fighting to keep the food down. CheonggangSim can see Peetas looking a little green, too. Neither of our

stomachs is used to such rich fare. But if CheonggangSim can hold down Greasy Saes concoction of mice meat, pig entrails, and tree bark a winter specialty CheonggangSimm determined to hang on to this. We go to another compartment to watch the recap of the reapings across Panem. They try to stagger them throughout the day so a person could conceivably watch the whole thing live, but only people in the Capitol could really do that, since none of them have to attend reapings themselves. One by one, we see the other reapings, the names called, (the volunteers stepping forward or, more often, not. We examine the faces of the kids who will be our competition. A few stand out in my mind. A

monstrous boy who lunges forward to volunteer from District 2. A fox-faced girl with sleek red hair from District 5. A boy with a crippled foot from District 10. And most hauntingly, a twelve-year-old girl from District 11. She has dark brown skin and eyes, but other than that, shes very like Prim in size and demeanor. Only when she mounts the stage and they ask for volunteers, all you can hear is the wind whistling through the decrepit buildings around her. Theres no one willing to take her place. Last of all, they show District 12. Prim being called, me running forward to

volunteer. You cant miss the desperation in my voice as CheonggangSim shove Prim behind me, as if CheonggangSimm afraid no one will hear and theyll take Prim away. But, of course, they do hear. CheonggangSim see Gale pulling her off me and watch myself mount the stage. The commentators are not sure what to say about the crowds refusal to applaud. The silent salute. One says that District 12 has always been a bit backward but that local customs can be charming. As if on cue, Haymitch falls off the stage, and they groan comically. Peetas name is drawn, and he quietly takes his place. We shake hands. They cut to the anthem again, and the pro-gram ends. Effie Trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig was in. Your mentor has a lot to learn about presentation. A lot about televised behavior. Peeta unexpectedly laughs. He was drunk, says Peeta. Hes drunk every year. Every day, CheonggangSim add. CheonggangSim cant help smirking a little. Effie Trinket makes it sound like Haymitch just has somewhat rough manners that could be corrected with a few tips from her. Yes, hisses Effie Trinket. How odd you two find it amusing. You know your mentor is your lifeline to the world in these Games. The one who advises you, lines up your sponsors, and dictates the presentation of any gifts. Haymitch can well be the difference between your life and your death! Just then,

Haymitch staggers into the compartment. CheonggangSim miss supper? he says in a slurred voice. Then he vomits all over the expensive carpet and falls in the mess. So laugh away! says Effie Trinket. She hops in her pointy shoes around the pool of vomit and flees the room.

4.

For a few moments, Peeta and CheonggangSim take in the scene of our mentor trying to rise out of the slippery vile stuff from his stomach. The reek of vomit and raw spirits almost brings my dinner up. We exchange a glance. Obviously Haymitch isnt much, but Effie Trinket is right about one thing, once were in the arena hes all weve got. As if by some unspoken agreement, Peeta and CheonggangSim each take one of Haymitchs arms and help him to his feet. CheonggangSim tripped? Haymitch asks. Smells bad. He wipes his hand on his nose, smearing his face with vomit. Lets get you back to your room, says Peeta. Clean you up a bit. We half-lead half-carry Haymitch back to his compartment. Since we cant exactly set him down on the embroidered bedspread, we haul him into the bathtub

and turn the shower on him. He hardly notices. CheonggangSimts okay, Peeta says to me. CheonggangSimll take it from here. CheonggangSim cant

help feeling a little grateful since the last thing CheonggangSim want to do is strip down Haymitch, wash the vomit out of his chest hair, and tuck him into bed. Possibly Peeta is trying to make a good impression on him, to be his favorite once the Games begin. But judging by the state hes in, Haymitch will have no memory of this tomorrow. All right, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim can send one of the Capitol people to help you. Theres any number on the train. Cooking for us. Waiting on us. Guarding us. Taking care of us is their job. No. CheonggangSim dont want them, says Peeta. CheonggangSim nod and head to my own room. CheonggangSim understand how Peeta feels. CheonggangSim cant stand the sight of the Capitol people myself. But making them deal with Haymitch might be a small form of revenge. So CheonggangSimm pondering the reason why he insists on taking care of Haymitch and all of a sudden CheonggangSim think, CheonggangSimts because hes being kind. Just as he was kind to give me the bread. The idea pulls me up short. A kind Peeta Mellark is far more dangerous to me than an unkind one. Kind people have a way of working their way inside me and rooting there. And CheonggangSim cant let Peeta do this.

Not where were going. So CheonggangSim decide, from this moment on, to have as little as possible to do with the bakers son. When CheonggangSim get back to my room, the train is pausing at a platform to refuel. CheonggangSim quickly open the window, toss the cookies Peetas father gave me out of the train, and slam the glass shut. No more. No more of either of them. Unfortunately, the packet of cookies hits the ground and bursts open in a patch of dandelions by the track. CheonggangSim only see the image for a moment, because the train is off again, but its enough. Enough to remind me of that other dandelion in the school yard years ago . . . CheonggangSim had just turned away from Peeta Mellarks bruised face when CheonggangSim saw the dandelion and CheonggangSim knew hope wasnt lost. CheonggangSim plucked it carefully and hurried home. CheonggangSim grabbed a bucket and Prims hand and headed to the Meadow and yes, it was dotted with the golden-headed weeds. After wed harvested those, we scrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile until wed filled the bucket with the dandelion greens, stems, and flowers. That night, we gorged ourselves on dandelion salad and the rest of the bakery bread. What else? Prim asked me. What other food can we find? All kinds of things, CheonggangSim promised her. CheonggangSim just have to remember them. My mother had a book shed brought with her from the apothecary shop. The pages were

made of old parchment and covered in ink drawings of plants. Neat handwritten blocks told their names, where to gather them, when they came in bloom, their medical uses. But my father added other entries to the book. Plants for eating, not healing. Dandelions, pokeweed, wild onions, pines. Prim and CheonggangSim spent the rest of the night poring over those pages. The next day, we were off school. For a while CheonggangSim hung around the edges of the Meadow, but finally CheonggangSim worked up the courage to go under the fence. CheonggangSimt was the first time CheonggangSimd been there alone, without my fathers weapons to protect me. But CheonggangSim

retrieved the small bow and arrows hed made me from a hollow tree. CheonggangSim probably didnt go more than twenty yards into the woods that day. Most of the time, CheonggangSim perched up in the branches of an old oak, hoping for game to come by. After several hours, CheonggangSim had the good luck to kill a rabbit. CheonggangSimd shot a few rabbits before, with my fathers guidance. But this CheonggangSimd done on my own. We hadnt had meat in months. The sight of the rabbit seemed to stir something in my mother. She roused herself, skinned the carcass, and made a stew with the meat and some more greens Prim had

gathered. Then she acted confused and went back to bed, but when the stew was done, we made her eat a bowl. The woods became our savior, and each day CheonggangSim went a bit farther into its arms. CheonggangSimt was slow-going at first, but CheonggangSim was determined to feed us. CheonggangSim stole eggs from nests, caught fish in nets, sometimes managed to shoot a squirrel or rabbit for stew, and gathered the various plants that sprung up beneath my feet. Plants are tricky. Many are edible, but one false mouthful and youre dead. CheonggangSim checked and double-checked the plants CheonggangSim harvested with my fathers pictures. CheonggangSim kept us alive. Any sign of danger, a distant howl, the inexplicable break of a branch, sent me flying back to the fence at first. Then CheonggangSim began to risk climbing trees to escape the wild dogs that quickly got bored and moved on. Bears and cats lived deeper in, perhaps disliking the sooty reek of our district. On May 8th, CheonggangSim went to the Justice Building, signed up for my tesserae, and pulled home my first batch of grain and oil in Prims toy wagon. On the eighth of every month, CheonggangSim was entitled to do the same. CheonggangSim couldnt stop hunting and gathering, of course. The grain was not enough to live on, and there were other things to buy, soap and milk and thread. What we didnt absolutely have to eat, CheonggangSim began to trade at the Hob. CheonggangSimt was frightening to enter that place without my

father at my side, but people had respected him, and they accepted me. Game was game after all, no matter whod shot it. CheonggangSim also sold at the back doors of the wealthier clients in town, trying to remember what my father had told me and learning a few new tricks as well. The butcher would buy my rabbits but not squirrels. The baker enjoyed squirrel but would only trade for one if his wife wasnt around. The Head Peacekeeper loved wild turkey. The mayor had a passion for strawberries. CheonggangSimn late summer, CheonggangSim was washing up in a pond when CheonggangSim noticed the plants growing around me. Tall with leaves like arrowheads. Blossoms with three white petals. CheonggangSim knelt down in the water, my fingers digging into the soft mud, and CheonggangSim pulled up handfuls of the roots. Small, bluish tubers that dont look like much but boiled or baked are as good as any potato. Katniss, CheonggangSim said aloud. CheonggangSimts the plant CheonggangSim was named for. And CheonggangSim heard my fathers voice joking, As long as you can find yourself, youll never starve. CheonggangSim spent hours stirring up the pond bed with my toes and a stick, gathering the tubers that floated to the top.

That night, we feasted on fish and Katniss roots until we were all, for the first

time in months, full. Slowly, my mother returned to us. She began to clean and cook and preserve some of the food CheonggangSim brought in for winter. People traded us or paid money for her medical remedies. One day, CheonggangSim heard her singing. Prim was thrilled to have her back, but CheonggangSim kept watching, waiting for her to disappear on us again. CheonggangSim didnt trust her. And some small gnarled place inside me hated her for her weakness, for her neglect, for the months she had put us through. Prim forgave her, but CheonggangSim had taken a step back from my mother, put up a wall to protect myself from needing her, and nothing was ever the same between us again. Now CheonggangSim was going to die without that ever being set right. CheonggangSim thought of how CheonggangSim had yelled at her today in the Justice Building. CheonggangSim had told her CheonggangSim loved her, too, though. So maybe it would all balance out. For a while CheonggangSim stand staring out the train window, wishing CheonggangSim could open it again, but unsure of what would happen at such high speed. CheonggangSimn the distance, CheonggangSim see the lights of another district. 7? 10? CheonggangSim dont know. CheonggangSim think about the people in their houses, settling in for bed. CheonggangSim imagine my home, with its shutters drawn tight. What are they doing now, my mother and Prim? Were they able to eat supper? The fish stew and the strawberries? Or did it lay untouched on their plates? Did they watch the recap of the days events on the battered old TV that sits on the table against the wall? Surely, there were more tears. CheonggangSims my mother holding up, being strong for Prim? Or has she already started to slip away, leaving the weight of the world on my sisters fragile shoulders? Prim will undoubtedly sleep with my mother tonight. The thought of that scruffy old Buttercup posting himself on the bed to watch over Prim comforts me. CheonggangSimf she cries, he will nose his way into her arms and curl up there until she calms down and falls asleep. CheonggangSimm so glad CheonggangSim didnt drown him. CheonggangSimmagining my home makes me ache with loneliness. This day has been endless. Could Gale and CheonggangSim have been eating blackberries only this morning? CheonggangSimt seems like a lifetime ago. Like a long dream that deteriorated into a nightmare. Maybe, if CheonggangSim go to sleep, CheonggangSim will wake up back in District 12, where CheonggangSim belong. Probably the drawers hold any number of nightgowns, but CheonggangSim just strip off my shirt and pants and climb into bed in my underwear. The sheets are made of soft, silky fabric. A thick fluffy comforter gives immediate warmth. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSimm going to cry, now is the time to do it. By morning, CheonggangSimll be able to wash the damage done by the tears from my face. But no tears come. CheonggangSimm too tired or too numb to cry. The only thing CheonggangSim feel is a desire to be somewhere else. So CheonggangSim let the train rock me into oblivion. Gray light is leaking through

the curtains when the rapping rouses me. CheonggangSim hear Effie Trinkets voice, calling me to rise. Up, up, up! CheonggangSimts going to be a big, big, big day! CheonggangSim try and imagine, for a moment, what it must be like inside that

womans head. What thoughts fill her waking hours? What dreams come to her at night? CheonggangSim have no idea. CheonggangSim put the green outfit back on since its not really dirty, just slightly crumpled from spending the night on the floor. My fingers trace the circle around the little gold mockingjay and CheonggangSim think of the woods, and of my father, and of my mother and Prim waking up, having to get on with things. CheonggangSim slept in the elaborate braided hair my mother did for the reaping and it doesnt look too bad, so CheonggangSim just leave it up. CheonggangSimt doesnt matter. We cant be far from the Capitol now. And once we reach the city, my stylist will dictate my look for the opening ceremonies tonight anyway. CheonggangSim just hope CheonggangSim get one who doesnt think nudity is the last word in fashion. As CheonggangSim enter the dining car, Effie Trinket brushes by me with a cup of black coffee. Shes muttering obscenities under her breath. Haymitch, his face puffy and red from the previous days indulgences, is chuckling. Peeta holds a roll and looks somewhat embarrassed.Sit down! Sit down! says Haymitch, waving me over. The moment CheonggangSim slide into my chair CheonggangSimm served an enormous platter of food. Eggs, ham, piles of fried potatoes. A tureen of fruit sits in ice to keep it chilled. The basket of rolls they set before me would keep my family going for a week. Theres an elegant glass of orange juice. At least, CheonggangSim think its orange juice. CheonggangSimve only even tasted an orange once, at New Years when my father bought one as a special treat. A cup of coffee. My mother adores coffee, which we could almost never afford, but it only tastes bitter and thin to me. A rich brown cup of something CheonggangSimve never seen. They call it hot chocolate, says Peeta. CheonggangSimts good. CheonggangSim take a sip of the hot, sweet, creamy liquid and a shudder runs through me. Even though the rest of the meal beckons, CheonggangSim ignore it until CheonggangSimve drained my cup. Then CheonggangSim stuff down every mouthful CheonggangSim can hold, which is a substantial amount, being careful to not overdo it on the richest stuff. One time, my mother told me that CheonggangSim always eat like CheonggangSimll never see food again. And CheonggangSim said, CheonggangSim wont unless CheonggangSim bring it home. That shut her up. When my stomach feels like its about to split open, CheonggangSim lean back and take in my breakfast companions. Peeta is still eating, breaking off bits of roll and dipping them in hot chocolate. Haymitch hasnt paid much attention to his platter, but hes knocking

back a glass of red juice that he keeps thinning with a clear liquid from a bottle. Judging by the fumes, its some kind of spirit. CheonggangSim dont know Haymitch, but CheonggangSimve seen him often enough in the Hob, tossing handfuls of money on the counter of the woman who sells white liquor. Hell be incoherent by the time we reach the Capitol. CheonggangSim realize CheonggangSim detest Haymitch. No wonder the District 12 tributes never stand a chance. CheonggangSimt isnt just that weve been underfed and lack training. Some of our tributes have still been strong enough to make a go of it. But we rarely get sponsors and hes a big part of the reason why. The rich people who back tributes

either because theyre betting on them or simply for the bragging rights of picking a winner expect someone classier than Haymitch to deal with. So, youre supposed to give us advice, CheonggangSim say to Haymitch. Heres some advice. Stay alive, says Haymitch, and then bursts out laughing. CheonggangSim exchange a look with Peeta before CheonggangSim remember CheonggangSimm having nothing more to do with him. CheonggangSimm surprised to see the hardness in his eyes. He generally seems so mild. Thats very funny, says Peeta. Suddenly he lashes out at the glass in Haymitchs hand. CheonggangSimt shatters on the floor, sending the bloodred liquid running toward the back of the train. Only not to us. Haymitch considers this a moment, then punches Peeta in the jaw, knocking him from his chair. When he turns back to reach for the spirits, CheonggangSim drive my knife into the table between his hand and the bottle, barely missing his fingers. CheonggangSim brace myself to deflect his hit, but it doesnt come. CheonggangSimnstead he sits back and squints at us. Well, whats this? says Haymitch. Did CheonggangSim actually get a pair of fighters this year? Peeta rises from the floor and scoops up a handful of ice from under the fruit tureen. He starts to raise it to the red mark on his jaw. No, says Haymitch, stopping him. Let the bruise show. The audience will think youve mixed it up with another tribute before youve even made it to the arena. Thats against the rules, says Peeta. Only if they catch you. That bruise will say you fought, you werent caught, even better, says Haymitch. He turns to me. Can you hit anything with that knife besides a table? The bow and arrow is my weapon. But CheonggangSimve spent a fair amount of time throwing knives as well. Sometimes, if CheonggangSimve wounded an animal with an arrow, its better to get a knife into it, too, before CheonggangSim approach it. CheonggangSim realize that if CheonggangSim want Haymitchs attention, this is my moment to make an impression. CheonggangSim yank the knife out of the table, get a grip on the blade, and then throw it into the wall

across the room. CheonggangSim was actually just hoping to get a good solid stick, but it lodges in the seam between two panels, making me look a lot better than CheonggangSim am. Stand over here. Both of you, says Haymitch, nodding to the middle of the room. We obey and he circles us, prodding us like animals at times, checking our muscles, examining our faces. Well, youre not entirely hopeless. Seem fit. And once the stylists get hold of you, youll be attractive enough. Peeta and CheonggangSim dont question this. The Hunger Games arent a beauty contest, but the best-looking tributes always seem to pull more sponsors. All right, CheonggangSimll make a deal with you. You dont interfere with my drinking, and CheonggangSimll stay sober enough to help you, says Haymitch. But you have to do exactly what CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSimts not much of a deal but still a giant step forward from ten minutes ago when we had no guide at all. Fine, says Peeta. So help us, CheonggangSim say. When we get to the arena, whats the best strategy at the Cornucopia for someone One thing at a time. CheonggangSimn a few minutes, well be pulling into the station. Youll be put in the

hands of your stylists. Youre not going to like what they do to you. But no matter what it is, dont resist, says Haymitch. But CheonggangSim begin. No buts. Dont resist, says Haymitch. He takes the bottle of spirits from the table and leaves the car. As the door swings shut behind him, the car goes dark. There are still a few lights inside, but outside its as if night has fallen again. CheonggangSim realize we must be in the tunnel that runs up through the mountains into the Capitol. The mountains form a natural barrier between the Capitol and the eastern districts. CheonggangSimt is almost impossible to enter from the east except through the tunnels. This geographical advantage was a major factor in the districts losing the war that led to my being a tribute today. Since the rebels had to scale the mountains, they were easy targets for the Capitols air forces. Peeta Mellark and CheonggangSim stand in silence as the train speeds along. The tunnel goes on and on and CheonggangSim think of the tons of rock separating me from the sky, and my chest tightens. CheonggangSim hate being encased in stone this way. CheonggangSimt reminds me of the mines and my father, trapped, unable to reach sunlight, buried forever in the darkness. The train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright light floods the compartment. We cant help it. Both Peeta and CheonggangSim run to the window to see what weve only seen on television, the Capitol, the ruling city of Panem. The cameras havent lied about its grandeur. CheonggangSimf anything, they have not quite captured the magnificence of the glistening buildings in

a rainbow of hues that tower into the air, the shiny cars that roll down the wide paved streets, the oddly dressed people with bizarre hair and painted faces who have never missed a meal. All the colors seem artificial, the pinks too deep, the greens too bright, the yellows painful to the eyes, like the flat round disks of hard candy we can never afford to buy at the tiny sweet shop in District 12. The people begin to point at us eagerly as they recognize a tribute train rolling into the city. CheonggangSim step away from the window, sickened by their excitement, knowing they cant wait to watch us die. But Peeta holds his ground, actually waving and smiling at the gawking crowd. He only stops when the train pulls into the station, blocking us from their view. He sees me staring at him and shrugs. Who knows? he says. One of them may be rich. CheonggangSim have misjudged him. CheonggangSim think of his actions since the reaping began. The friendly squeeze of my hand. His father showing up with the cookies and promising to feed Prim . . . Did Peeta put him up to that? His tears at the station. Volunteering to wash Haymitch but then challenging him this morning when apparently the nice-guy approach had failed. And now the waving at the window, already trying to win the crowd. All of the pieces are still fitting together, but CheonggangSim sense he has a plan forming. He hasnt accepted

his death. He is already fighting hard to stay alive. Which also means that kind Peeta Mellark, the boy who gave me the bread, is

fighting hard to kill me.

5.

R-i-i-i-p! CheonggangSim grit my teeth as Venia, a woman with aqua hair and gold tattoos above her eyebrows, yanks a strip of Fabric from my leg tearing out the hair beneath it. Sorry! she pipes in her silly Capitol accent. Youre just so hairy! Why do these people speak in such a high pitch? Why do their jaws barely open when they talk? Why do the ends of their sentences go up as if theyre asking a question? Odd vowels, clipped words, and always a hiss on the letter s . . . No wonder its impossible not to mimic them. Venia makes whats supposed to be a sympathetic face. Good news, though. This is the last one. Ready? CheonggangSim get a grip on the edges of the table CheonggangSimm seated on and nod. The final swathe of my leg hair is uprooted in a painful jerk. CheonggangSimve been in the Remake Center for more than three hours and CheonggangSim still havent met my stylist. Apparently he has no interest in seeing me until Venia and the other members of my prep team have addressed some obvious problems. This has included scrubbing down my body with a gritty loam that has removed not only dirt but at least three layers of skin, turning my nails into uniform shapes, and primarily, ridding my body of hair. My legs, arms, torso, underarms, and parts of my eyebrows have been stripped of the Muff, leaving me like a plucked bird, ready for roasting. CheonggangSim dont like it. My skin feels sore and tingling

and intensely vulnerable. But CheonggangSim have kept my side of the bargain with Haymitch, and no objection has crossed my lips. Youre doing very well, says some guy named Flavius. He gives his orange corkscrew locks a shake and applies a fresh coat of purple lipstick to his mouth. CheonggangSimf theres one thing we cant stand, its a whiner. Grease her down! Venia and Octavia, a plump woman whose entire body has been dyed a pale shade of pea green, rub me down with a lotion that first stings but then soothes my raw skin. Then they pull me from the table, removing the thin robe CheonggangSimve been allowed to wear off and on. CheonggangSim stand there, completely naked, as the three circle me, wielding tweezers to remove any last bits of hair. CheonggangSim know CheonggangSim should be embarrassed, but theyre so unlike people that CheonggangSimm no more self-conscious than if a trio of oddly colored birds were pecking around my feet. The three step back and admire their work. Excellent! You almost look like a human being now! says Flavius, and they all laugh. CheonggangSim force my lips up into a smile to show how grateful CheonggangSim am. Thank you, CheonggangSim say sweetly. We dont have much cause to look nice in District Twelve. This wins them over completely. Of course, you dont, you poor darling! says Octavia clasping her hands together in distress for me. But dont worry, says Venia. By the time Cinna is through with you, youre going to be absolutely gorgeous! We promise! You know, now that weve gotten rid of all the hair and filth, youre not horrible at all! says Flavius encouragingly. Lets call Cinna! They dart out of the room. CheonggangSimts hard to hate my prep team. Theyre such total idiots. And yet, in an odd way, CheonggangSim know

theyre sincerely trying to help me. CheonggangSim look at the cold white walls and floor and resist the impulse to retrieve my robe. But this Cinna, my stylist, will surely make me remove it at once. CheonggangSimnstead my hands go to my hairdo, the one area of my body my prep team had been told to leave alone. My fingers stroke the silky braids my mother so carefully arranged. My mother. CheonggangSim left her blue dress and shoes on the floor of my train car, never thinking about retrieving them, of trying to hold on to a piece of her, of home. Now CheonggangSim wish CheonggangSim had. The door opens and a young man who must be Cinna enters. CheonggangSimm taken aback by how normal he looks. Most of the stylists they interview on television are so dyed, stenciled, and surgically altered theyre grotesque. But Cinnas close-cropped hair appears to be its natural shade of brown. Hes in a simple black shirt and pants. The only concession to self-alteration seems to be metallic gold

eyeliner that has been applied with a light hand. CheonggangSimt brings out the flecks of gold in his green eyes. And, despite my disgust with the Capitol and their hideous fashions, CheonggangSim cant help thinking how attractive it looks. Hello, Katniss. CheonggangSimm Cinna, your stylist, he says in a quiet voice somewhat lacking in the Capitols affectations. Hello, CheonggangSim venture cautiously. Just give me a moment, all right? he asks. He walks around my naked body, not touching me, but taking in every inch of it with his eyes. CheonggangSim resist the impulse to cross my arms over my chest. Who did your hair? My mother, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSimts beautiful. Classic really. And in almost perfect balance with your profile. She has very clever fingers, he says. CheonggangSim had expected someone flamboyant, someone older trying desperately to look young, someone who viewed me as a piece of meat to be prepared for a platter. Cinna has met none of these expectations. Youre new, arent you? CheonggangSim dont think CheonggangSimve seen you before, CheonggangSim say. Most of the stylists are familiar, constants in the ever-changing pool of tributes. Some have been around my whole life. Yes, this is my first year in the Games, says Cinna. So they gave you District Twelve, CheonggangSim say. Newcomers generally end up with us, the least desirable district. CheonggangSim asked for District Twelve, he says without further explanation. Why dont you put on your robe and well have a chat. Pulling on my robe, CheonggangSim follow him through a door into a sitting room. Two red couches face off over a low table. Three walls are blank, the fourth is entirely glass, providing a window to the city. CheonggangSim can see by the light that it must be around noon, although the sunny sky has turned overcast. Cinna invites me to sit on one of the couches and takes his place across from me. He presses a button on the side of the table. The top splits and from below rises a second tabletop that holds our lunch. Chicken and chunks of oranges cooked in a creamy sauce laid on a bed of pearly white grain, tiny green peas and onions, rolls shaped like flowers, and for dessert, a pudding the color of honey. CheonggangSim try to imagine

assembling this meal myself back home. Chickens are too expensive, but CheonggangSim could make do with a wild turkey. CheonggangSimd need to shoot a second turkey to trade for an orange. Goats milk would have to substitute for cream. We can grow peas in the garden. CheonggangSimd have to get wild onions from the woods. CheonggangSim dont recognize the grain, our own tessera ration cooks down to an unattractive brown mush. Fancy rolls would mean another trade with the baker, perhaps for two or three squirrels. As for the

pudding, CheonggangSim cant even guess whats in it. Days of hunting and gathering for this one meal and even then it would be a poor substitution for the Capitol version. What must it be like, CheonggangSim wonder, to live in a world where food appears at the press of a button? How would CheonggangSim spend the hours CheonggangSim now commit to combing the woods for sustenance if it were so easy to come by? What do they do all day, these people in the Capitol, besides decorating their bodies and waiting around for a new shipment of tributes to roll in and die for their entertainment? CheonggangSim look up and find Cinnas eyes trained on mine. How despicable we must seem to you, he says. Has he seen this in my face or somehow read my thoughts? Hes right, though. The whole rotten lot of them is despicable. No matter, says Cinna. So, Katniss, about your costume for the opening ceremonies. My partner, Portia, is the stylist for your fellow tribute, Peeta. And our current thought is to dress you in complementary costumes, says Cinna. As you know, its customary to reflect the flavor of the district. For the opening ceremonies, youre supposed to wear something that suggests your districts principal industry. District 11, agriculture. District 4, fishing. District 3, factories. This means that coming from District 12, Peeta and CheonggangSim will be in some kind of coal miners getup.Since the baggy miners jumpsuits are not particularly becoming, our tributes usually end up in skimpy outfits and hats with headlamps. One year, our tributes were stark naked and covered in black powder to represent coal dust. CheonggangSimts always dreadful and does nothing to win favor with the crowd. CheonggangSim prepare myself for the worst. So, CheonggangSimll be in a coal miner outfit? CheonggangSim ask, hoping it wont be indecent. Not exactly. You see, Portia and CheonggangSim think that coal miner things very overdone. No one will remember you in that. And we both see it as our job to make the District Twelve tributes unforgettable, says Cinna. CheonggangSimll be naked for sure, CheonggangSim think. So rather than focus on the coal mining itself, were going to focus on the coal, says Cinna. Naked and covered in black dust, CheonggangSim think. And what do we do with coal? We burn it, says Cinna. Youre not afraid of fire, are you, Katniss? He sees my expression and grins. A few hours later, CheonggangSim am dressed in what will either be the most sensational or the deadliest costume in the opening ceremonies. CheonggangSimm in a simple black unitard that covers me from ankle to neck. Shiny leather boots lace up to my knees. But its the fluttering cape made of streams of orange, yellow,


and red and the matching headpiece that define this costume. Cinna plans to light them on fire just before our chariot rolls into the streets. CheonggangSimts not real flame, of course, just a little synthetic fire Portia and CheonggangSim came up with. Youll be perfectly safe, he says. But CheonggangSimm not convinced CheonggangSim wont be perfectly barbecued by the time we reach the citys center. My face is relatively clear of makeup, just a bit of highlighting here and there. My hair has been brushed out and then braided down my back in my usual style. CheonggangSim want the audience to recognize you when youre in the arena, says Cinna dreamily. Katniss, the girl who was on fire. CheonggangSimt crosses my mind that Cinnas calm and normal demeanor masks a complete madman. Despite this mornings revelation about Peetas character, CheonggangSimm actually relieved when he shows up, dressed in an identical costume. He should know about fire, being a bakers son and all. His stylist, Portia, and her team accompany him in, and everyone is absolutely giddy with excitement over what a splash well make. Except Cinna. He just seems a bit weary as he accepts congratulations. Were whisked down to the bottom level of the Remake Center, which is essentially a gigantic stable. The opening ceremonies are about to start. Pairs of tributes are being loaded into chariots pulled by teams of four horses.Ours are coal black. The animals are so well trained, no one even needs to guide their reins. Cinna and Portia direct us into the chariot and carefully arrange our body positions, the drape of our capes, before moving off to consult with each other. What do you think? CheonggangSim whisper to Peeta. About the fire? CheonggangSimll rip off your cape if youll rip off mine, he says through gritted teeth. Deal, CheonggangSim say. Maybe, if we can get them off soon enough, well avoid the worst burns. CheonggangSimts bad though. Theyll throw us into the arena no matter what condition were in. CheonggangSim know we promised Haymitch wed do exactly what they said, but CheonggangSim dont think he considered this angle. Where is Haymitch, anyway? CheonggangSimsnt he supposed to protect us from this sort of thing? says Peeta. With all that alcohol in him, its probably not advisable to have him around an open flame, CheonggangSim say. And suddenly were both laughing. CheonggangSim guess were both so nervous about the Games and more pressingly, petrified of being turned into human torches, were not acting sensibly. The opening music begins. CheonggangSimts easy to hear, blasted around the Capitol. Massive doors slide open revealing the crowd-lined streets. The ride lasts about twenty minutes and ends up at the City Circle, where they will welcome us, play the anthem, and escort us into the Training Center, which will be our home/prison until

the Games begin. The tributes from District 1 ride out in a chariot pulled by snow-white horses. They look so beautiful, spray-painted silver, in tasteful tunics glittering with jewels. District 1 makes luxury items for the Capitol. You can hear the roar of the crowd. They are always favorites. District 2 gets into position to follow them. CheonggangSimn

no time at all, we are approaching the door and CheonggangSim can see that between the overcast sky and evening hour the light is turning gray. The tributes from District 11 are just rolling out when Cinna appears with a lighted torch. Here we go then, he says, and before we can react he sets our capes on fire. CheonggangSim gasp, waiting for the heat, but there is only a faint tickling sensation. Cinna climbs up before us and ignites our headdresses. He lets out a sign of relief. CheonggangSimt works. Then he gently tucks a hand under my chin. Remember, heads high. Smiles. Theyre going to love you! Cinna jumps off the chariot and has one last idea. He shouts something up at us, but the music drowns him out. He shouts again and gestures. Whats he saying? CheonggangSim ask Peeta. For the first time, CheonggangSim look at him and realize that ablaze with the fake flames, he is dazzling. And CheonggangSim must be, too. CheonggangSim think he said for us to hold hands, says Peeta. He grabs my right hand in his left, and we look to Cinna for confirmation. He nods and gives a thumbs-up, and thats the last thing CheonggangSim see before we enter the city. The crowds initial alarm at our appearance quickly changes to cheers and shouts of District Twelve! Every head is turned our way, pulling the focus from the three chariots ahead of us. At first, CheonggangSimm frozen, but then CheonggangSim catch sight of us on a large television screen and am floored by how breathtaking we look. CheonggangSimn the deepening twilight, the firelight illuminates our faces. We seem to be leaving a trail of fire off the flowing capes. Cinna was right about the minimal makeup, we both look more attractive but utterly recognizable. Remember, heads high. Smiles. Theyre going to love you! CheonggangSim hear Cinnas voice in my head. CheonggangSim lift my chin a bit higher, put on my most winning smile, and wave with my free hand. CheonggangSimm glad now CheonggangSim have Peeta to clutch for balance, he is so steady, solid as a rock. As CheonggangSim gain confidence, CheonggangSim actually blow a few kisses to the crowd. The people of the Capitol are going nuts, showering us with flowers, shouting our names, our first names, which they have bothered to find on the program. The pounding music, the cheers, the admiration work their way into my blood, and CheonggangSim cant suppress my excitement. Cinna has given me a great advantage. No one will forget me. Not my look, not my name.

Katniss. The girl who was on fire. For the first time, CheonggangSim feel a flicker of hope rising up in me. Surely, there must be one sponsor willing to take me on! And with a little extra help, some food, the right weapon, why should CheonggangSim count myself out of the Games? Someone throws me a red rose. CheonggangSim catch it, give it a delicate sniff, and blow a kiss back in the general direction of the giver. A hundred hands reach up to catch my kiss, as if it were a real and tangible thing. Katniss! Katniss! CheonggangSim can hear my name being called from all sides. Everyone wants my kisses. CheonggangSimts not until we enter the City Circle that CheonggangSim realize CheonggangSim must have completely stopped the circulation in Peetas hand. Thats how tightly CheonggangSimve been holding it. CheonggangSim look

down at our linked fingers as CheonggangSim loosen my grasp, but he regains his grip on me. No, dont let go of me, he says. The firelight flickers off his blue eyes. Please. CheonggangSim might fall out of this thing. Okay, CheonggangSim say. So CheonggangSim keep holding on, but CheonggangSim cant help feeling strange about the way Cinna has linked us together. CheonggangSimts not really fair to present us as a team and then lock us into the arena to kill each other. The twelve chariots fill the loop of the City Circle. On the buildings that surround the Circle, every window is packed with the most prestigious citizens of the Capitol. Our horses pull our chariot right up to President Snows mansion, and we come to a halt. The music ends with a flourish. The president, a small, thin man with paper-white hair, gives the official welcome from a balcony above us. CheonggangSimt is traditional to cut away to the faces of the tributes during the speech. But CheonggangSim can see on the screen that we are getting way more than our share of airtime. The darker it becomes, the more difficult it is to take your eyes off our flickering. When the national anthem plays, they do make an effort to do a quick cut around to each pair of tributes, but the camera holds on the District 12 chariot as it parades around the circle one final time and disappears into the Training Center. The doors have only just shut behind us when were engulfed by the prep teams, who are nearly unintelligible as they babble out praise. As CheonggangSim glance around, CheonggangSim notice a lot of the other tributes are shooting us dirty looks, which confirms what CheonggangSimve suspected, weve literally outshone them all. Then Cinna and Portia are there, helping us down from the chariot, carefully removing our flaming capes and headdresses. Portia extinguishes them with some kind of spray from a canister. CheonggangSim realize CheonggangSimm still glued to Peeta and force my stiff fingers to open. We both massage our hands. Thanks

for keeping hold of me. CheonggangSim was getting a little shaky there, says Peeta. CheonggangSimt didnt show, CheonggangSim tell him. CheonggangSimm sure no one noticed. CheonggangSimm sure they didnt notice anything but you. You should wear flames more often, he says. They suit you. And then he gives me a smile that seems so genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me. A warning bell goes off in my head. Dont be so stupid. Peeta is planning how to kill you, CheonggangSim remind myself. He is luring you in to make you easy prey. The more likable he is, the more deadly he is. But because two can play at this game, CheonggangSim stand on tiptoe and kiss his cheek. Right on his bruise.

6.

The Training Center has a tower designed exclusively for the tributes and their teams. This will be our home until the actual Games begin. Each district has an entire floor. You simply step onto an elevator and press the number of your district. Easy enough to remember. CheonggangSimve ridden the elevator a couple of times in the Justice Building back in District 12. Once to receive the medal for my fathers death and then yesterday to say my final goodbyes to my friends and

family. But thats a dark and creaky thing that moves like a snail and smells of sour milk. The walls of this elevator are made of crystal so that you can watch the people on the ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into the air. CheonggangSimts exhilarating and CheonggangSimm tempted to ask Effie Trinket if we can ride it again, but somehow that seems childish. Apparently, Effie Trinkets duties did not conclude at the station. She and Haymitch will be overseeing us right into the arena. CheonggangSimn a way, thats a plus because at least she can be counted on to corral us around to places on time whereas we havent seen Haymitch since he agreed to help us on the train. Probably passed out somewhere. Effie Trinket, on the other hand, seems to be flying high. Were the first team shes ever chaperoned that made a splash at the opening ceremonies. Shes complimentary about not just our costumes but how we conducted ourselves. And, to hear her tell it, Effie knows everyone whos anyone in the Capitol and has been talking us up all day, trying to win us sponsors. CheonggangSimve been very mysterious, though, she says, her eyes squint half shut. Because, of course, Haymitch hasnt bothered to

tell me your strategies. But CheonggangSimve done my best with what CheonggangSim had to work with. How Katniss sacrificed herself for her sister. How youve both successfully struggled to overcome the barbarism of your district. Barbarism? Thats ironic coming from a woman helping to prepare us for slaughter. And whats she basing our success on? Our table manners? Everyone has their reservations, naturally. You being from the coal district. But CheonggangSim said, and this was very clever of me, CheonggangSim said, Well, if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to pearls! Effie beams at us so brilliantly that we have no choice but to respond enthusiastically to her cleverness even though its wrong. Coal doesnt turn to pearls. They grow in shellfish. Possibly she meant coal turns to diamonds, but thats untrue, too. CheonggangSimve heard they have some sort of machine in District 1 that can turn graphite into diamonds. But we dont mine graphite in District 12. That was part of District 13s job until they were destroyed. CheonggangSim wonder if the people shes been plugging us to all day either know or care. Unfortunately, CheonggangSim cant seal the sponsor deals for you. Only Haymitch can do that, says Effie grimly. But dont worry, CheonggangSimll get him to the table at gunpoint if necessary. Although lacking in many departments, Effie Trinket has a certain determination CheonggangSim have to admire. My quarters are larger than our entire house back home. They are plush, like the train car, but also have so many automatic gadgets that CheonggangSimm sure CheonggangSim wont have time to press all the buttons. The shower alone has a panel with more than a hundred options you can choose regulating water temperature, pressure, soaps, shampoos, scents, oils, and massaging sponges. When you step out on a mat, heaters come on that blow-dry your body. CheonggangSimnstead of struggling with the knots in my wet hair, CheonggangSim merely place my hand on a box that sends

a current through my scalp, untangling, parting, and drying my hair almost instantly. CheonggangSimt floats down around my shoulders in a glossy curtain. CheonggangSim program the closet for an outfit to my taste. The windows zoom in and out on parts of the city at my command. You need only whisper a type of food from a gigantic menu into a mouthpiece and it appears, hot and steamy, before you in less than a minute. CheonggangSim walk around the room eating goose liver and puffy bread until theres a knock on the door. Effies calling me to dinner. Good. CheonggangSimm starving. Peeta, Cinna, and Portia are standing out on a balcony that overlooks the Capitol when we enter the dining room. CheonggangSimm glad

to see the stylists, particularly after CheonggangSim hear that Haymitch will be joining us. A meal presided over by just Effie and Haymitch is bound to be a disaster. Besides, dinner isnt really about food, its about planning out our strategies, and Cinna and Portia have already proven how valuable they are. A silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers us all stemmed glasses of wine. CheonggangSim think about turning it down, but CheonggangSimve never had wine, except the homemade stuff my mother uses for coughs, and when will CheonggangSim get a chance to try it again? CheonggangSim take a sip of the tart, dry liquid and secretly think it could be improved by a few spoonfuls of honey. Haymitch shows up just as dinner is being served. CheonggangSimt looks as if hes had his own stylist because hes clean and groomed and about as sober as CheonggangSimve ever seen him. He doesnt refuse the offer of wine, but when he starts in on his soup, CheonggangSim realize its the first time CheonggangSimve ever seen him eat. Maybe he really will pull himself together long enough to help us. Cinna and Portia seem to have a civilizing effect on Haymitch and Effie. At least theyre addressing each other decently. And they both have nothing but praise for our stylists opening act. While they make small talk, CheonggangSim concentrate on the meal. Mushroom soup, bitter greens with tomatoes the size of peas, rare roast beef sliced as thin as paper, noodles in a green sauce, cheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet blue grapes. The servers, all young people dressed in white tunics like the one who gave us wine, move wordlessly to and from the table, keeping the platters and glasses full. About halfway through my glass of wine, my head starts feeling foggy, so CheonggangSim change to water instead. CheonggangSim dont like the feeling and hope it wears off soon. How Haymitch can stand walking around like this full-time is a mystery. CheonggangSim try to focus on the talk, which has turned to our interview costumes, when a girl sets a gorgeous-looking cake on the table and deftly lights it. CheonggangSimt blazes up and then the flames flicker around the edges awhile until it finally goes out. CheonggangSim have a moment of doubt. What makes it burn? CheonggangSims it alcohol? CheonggangSim say, looking up at the girl. Thats the last thing CheonggangSim wa oh! CheonggangSim know you! CheonggangSim cant place a name or time to the girls face. But CheonggangSimm certain of it. The dark red hair, the striking features, the porcelain white skin. But even as CheonggangSim utter the words, CheonggangSim feel my insides contracting with anxiety and guilt at the sight of her, and while CheonggangSim cant pull it up, CheonggangSim know some bad memory is associated with her. The expression of terror that crosses her face only adds to my confusion and unease. She shakes her head in denial quickly and hurries away from the table. When CheonggangSim look back, the four adults are watching me like hawks. Dont be ridiculous, Katniss. How could you possibly know an Avox? snaps Effie. The very thought. Whats an Avox? CheonggangSim ask stupidly. Someone who committed a crime. They cut her tongue so she cant speak, says Haymitch. Shes probably a traitor of some sort. Not likely youd know her. And even if you did, youre not to speak to one of them unless its to give an order, says Effie. Of course, you dont really know her. But CheonggangSim do know her. And now that Haymitch has mentioned the word traitor CheonggangSim remember from where. The

disapproval is so high CheonggangSim could never admit it. No, CheonggangSim guess not, CheonggangSim just CheonggangSim stammer, and the wine is not helping. Peeta snaps his fingers. Delly Cartwright. Thats who it is. CheonggangSim kept thinking she looked familiar as well. Then CheonggangSim realized shes a dead ringer for Delly. Delly Cartwright is a pasty-faced, lumpy girl with yellowish hair who looks about as much like our server as a beetle does a butterfly. She may also be the friendliest person on the planet she smiles constantly at everybody in school, even me. CheonggangSim have never seen the girl with the red hair smile. But CheonggangSim jump on Peetas suggestion gratefully. Of course, thats who CheonggangSim was thinking of. CheonggangSimt must be the hair, CheonggangSim say. Something about the eyes, too, says Peeta. The energy at the table relaxes. Oh, well. CheonggangSimf thats all it is, says Cinna. And yes, the cake has spirits, but all the alcohol has burned off. CheonggangSim ordered it specially in honor of your fiery debut. We eat the cake and move into a sitting room to watch the replay of the opening ceremonies thats being broadcast. A few of the other couples make a nice impression, but none of them can hold a candle to us. Even our own party lets out an Ahh! as they show us coming out of the Remake Center. Whose idea was the hand holding? asks Haymitch. Cinnas, says Portia. Just the perfect touch of rebellion, says Haymitch. Very nice. Rebellion? CheonggangSim have to think about that one a moment. But when CheonggangSim remember the other couples, standing stiffly apart, never touching or acknowledging each other, as if their fellow tribute did not exist, as if the Games had already begun, CheonggangSim know what Haymitch means. Presenting ourselves not as adversaries but as friends has distinguished us as much as the fiery costumes. Tomorrow morning is the first training session. Meet me for breakfast and CheonggangSimll tell you exactly how CheonggangSim want you to play it, says Haymitch to Peeta and CheonggangSim. Now go get some sleep while the grown-ups talk. Peeta and CheonggangSim walk together down the corridor to our rooms. When we get to my door, he leans against the frame, not blocking my entrance exactly but insisting CheonggangSim pay attention to him. So, Delly Cartwright.

CheonggangSimmagine finding her lookalike here. Hes asking for an explanation, and CheonggangSimm tempted to give him one. We both know he covered for me. So here CheonggangSim am in his debt again. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim tell him the truth about the girl, somehow that might even things up. How can it hurt really? Even if he repeated the story, it couldnt do me much harm. CheonggangSimt was just something CheonggangSim witnessed. And he lied as much as CheonggangSim did about Delly Cartwright. CheonggangSim realize CheonggangSim do want to talk to someone about the girl. Someone who might be able to

help me figure out her story. Gale would be my first choice, but its unlikely CheonggangSimll ever see Gale again. CheonggangSim try to think if telling Peeta could give him any possible advantage over me, but CheonggangSim dont see how. Maybe sharing a confidence will actually make him believe CheonggangSim see him as a friend. Besides, the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue frightens me. She has reminded me why CheonggangSimm here. Not to model flashy costumes and eat delicacies. But to die a bloody death while the crowds urge on my killer. To tell or not to tell? My brain still feels slow from the wine. CheonggangSim stare down the empty corridor as if the decision lies there. Peeta picks up on my hesitation. Have you been on the roof yet? CheonggangSim shake my head. Cinna showed me. You can practically see the whole city. The winds a bit loud, though. CheonggangSim translate this into No one will overhear us talking in my head. You do have the sense that we might be under surveillance here. Can we just go up? Sure, come on, says Peeta. CheonggangSim follow him to a flight of stairs that lead to the roof. Theres a small dome-shaped room with a door to the outside. As we step into the cool, windy evening air, CheonggangSim catch my breath at the view. The Capitol twinkles like a vast field of fireflies. Electricity in District 12 comes and goes, usually we only have it a few hours a day. Often the evenings are spent in candlelight. The only time you can count on it is when theyre airing the Games or some important government message on television that its mandatory to watch. But here there would be no shortage. Ever. Peeta and CheonggangSim walk to a railing at the edge of the roof. CheonggangSim look straight down the side of the building to the street, which is buzzing with people. You can hear their cars, an occasional shout, and a strange metallic tinkling. CheonggangSimn District 12, wed all be thinking about bed right now. CheonggangSim asked Cinna why they let us up here. Werent they worried that some of the tributes might decide to jump right over the side? says Peeta. Whatd he say? CheonggangSim ask. You cant, says Peeta. He holds out his hand into seemingly empty space. Theres a sharp zap and he jerks it back. Some kind of electric field throws you back on the roof. Always worried about our safety, CheonggangSim say. Even though Cinna has shown Peeta the roof, CheonggangSim wonder if were supposed to be up here now, so late and alone. CheonggangSimve never seen tributes on the Training Center roof before. But that doesnt mean were not being taped. Do you think theyre watching us now? Maybe, he admits. Come see the garden. On the other side of the dome,

theyve built a garden with flower beds and potted trees. From the branches

hang hundreds of wind chimes, which account for the tinkling CheonggangSim heard. Here in the garden, on this windy night, its enough to drown out two people who are trying not to be heard. Peeta looks at me expectantly. CheonggangSim pretend to examine a blossom. We were hunting in the woods one day. Hidden, waiting for game, CheonggangSim whisper. You and your father? he whispers back. No, my friend Gale. Suddenly all the birds stopped singing at once. Except one. As if it were giving a warning call. And then we saw her. CheonggangSimm sure it was the same girl. A boy was with her. Their clothes were tattered. They had dark circles under their eyes from no sleep. They were running as if their lives depended on it, CheonggangSim say. For a moment CheonggangSimm silent, as CheonggangSim remember how the sight of this strange pair, clearly not from District 12, fleeing through the woods immobilized us. Later, we wondered if we could have helped them escape. Perhaps we might have. Concealed them. CheonggangSimf wed moved quickly. Gale and CheonggangSim were taken by surprise, yes, but were both hunters. We know how animals look at bay. We knew the pair was in trouble as soon as we saw them. But we only watched. The hovercraft appeared out of nowhere, CheonggangSim continue to Peeta. CheonggangSim mean, one moment the sky was empty and the next it was there. CheonggangSimt didnt make a sound, but they saw it. A net dropped down on the girl and carried her up, fast, so fast like the elevator. They shot some sort of spear through the boy. CheonggangSimt was attached to a cable and they hauled him up as well. But CheonggangSimm certain he was dead. We heard the girl scream once. The boys name, CheonggangSim think. Then it was gone, the hovercraft. Vanished into thin air. And the birds began to sing again, as if nothing had happened. Did they see you? Peeta asked. CheonggangSim dont know. We were under a shelf of rock, CheonggangSim reply. But CheonggangSim do know. There was a moment, after the birdcall, but before the hovercraft, where the girl had seen us. Shed locked eyes with me and called out for help. But neither Gale or CheonggangSim had responded. Youre shivering, says Peeta. The wind and the story have blown all the warmth from my body. The girls scream. Had it been her last? Peeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my shoulders. CheonggangSim start to take a step back, but then CheonggangSim let him, deciding for a moment to accept both his jacket and his kindness. A friend would do that, right? They were from here? he asks, and he secures a button at my neck. CheonggangSim nod. Theyd had that Capitol look about them. The boy and the girl. Where do you suppose they were going? he asks. CheonggangSim dont know that, CheonggangSim say. District 12 is pretty much the end of the line. Beyond us, theres only wilderness. CheonggangSimf you dont count the ruins of District 13 that still smolder from the toxic

bombs. They show it on television occasionally, just to remind us. Or why they would leave here. Haymitch had called the Avoxes traitors. Against what? CheonggangSimt could only be the Capitol. But they had everything here. No cause to rebel. CheonggangSimd leave here, Peeta blurts

out. Then he looks around nervously. CheonggangSimt was loud enough to hear above the chimes. He laughs. CheonggangSimd go home now if they let me. But you have to admit, the foods prime. Hes covered again. CheonggangSimf thats all youd heard it would just sound like the words of a scared tribute, not someone contemplating the unquestionable goodness of the Capitol. CheonggangSimts getting chilly. We better go in, he says. CheonggangSimnside the dome, its warm and bright. His tone is conversational. Your friend Gale. Hes the one who took your sister away at the reaping? Yes. Do you know him? CheonggangSim ask. Not really. CheonggangSim hear the girls talk about him a lot. CheonggangSim thought he was your cousin or something. You favor each other, he says. No, were not related, CheonggangSim say. Peeta nods, unreadable. Did he come to say good-bye to you? Yes, CheonggangSim say, observing him carefully. So did your father. He brought me cookies. Peeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news. But after watching him lie so smoothly, CheonggangSim dont give this much weight. Really? Well, he likes you and your sister. CheonggangSim think he wishes he had a daughter instead of a houseful of boys. The idea that CheonggangSim might ever have been discussed, around the dinner table, at the bakery fire, just in passing in Peetas house gives me a start. CheonggangSimt must have been when the mother was out of the room. He knew your mother when they were kids, says Peeta. Another surprise. But probably true. Oh, yes. She grew up in town, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSimt seems impolite to say she never mentioned the baker except to compliment his bread. Were at my door. CheonggangSim give back his jacket. See you in the morning then. See you, he says, and walks off down the hall. When CheonggangSim open my door, the redheaded girl is collecting my unitard and boots from where CheonggangSim left them on the floor before my shower. CheonggangSim want to apologize for possibly getting her in trouble earlier. But CheonggangSim remember CheonggangSimm not supposed to speak to her unless CheonggangSimm giving her an order. Oh, sorry, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim was supposed to get those back to Cinna. CheonggangSimm sorry. Can you take them to him? She avoids my eyes, gives a small nod, and heads out the door. CheonggangSimd set out to tell her CheonggangSim was sorry about dinner. But CheonggangSim know that my apology runs much deeper. That CheonggangSimm ashamed CheonggangSim never tried to help her in the woods. That CheonggangSim let the Capitol kill the boy and mutilate her without lifting a

finger. Just like CheonggangSim was watching the Games. CheonggangSim kick off my shoes and climb under the covers in my clothes. The shivering hasnt stopped. Perhaps the girl doesnt even remember me. But CheonggangSim know she does. You dont forget the face of the person who was your last hope. CheonggangSim pull the covers up over my head as if this will protect me from the redheaded girl who cant speak. But CheonggangSim can feel her eyes staring at me, piercing through walls and doors and bedding. CheonggangSim wonder if shell enjoy watching me die.

7.

My slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams. The face of the redheaded girl intertwines with gory images from earlier Hunger Games, with my mother withdrawn and unreachable, with Prim emaciated and terrified. CheonggangSim bolt up screaming for my father to run as the mine

explodes into a million deadly bits of light. Dawn is breaking through the windows. The Capitol has a misty, haunted air. My head aches and CheonggangSim must have bitten into the side of my cheek in the night. My tongue probes the ragged flesh and CheonggangSim taste blood. Slowly, CheonggangSim drag myself out of bed and into the shower. CheonggangSim arbitrarily punch buttons on the control board and end up hopping from foot to foot as alternating jets of icy cold and steaming hot water assault me. Then CheonggangSimm deluged in lemony foam that CheonggangSim have to scrape off with a heavy bristled brush. Oh, well. At least my blood is flowing. When CheonggangSimm dried and moisturized with lotion, CheonggangSim find an outfit has been left for me at the front of the closet. Tight black pants, a long-sleeved burgundy tunic, and leather shoes. CheonggangSim put my hair in the single braid down my back. This is the first time since the morning of the reaping that CheonggangSim resemble myself. No fancy hair and clothes, no flaming capes. Just me. Looking like CheonggangSim could be headed for the woods. CheonggangSimt calms me. Haymitch didnt give us an exact time to meet for break-last and no one has contacted me this morning, but CheonggangSimm hungry so CheonggangSim head down to the dining room, hoping there will be food. CheonggangSimm not disappointed. While the table is empty, a long board off to the side has been laid with at least twenty dishes. A young man, an Avox, stands at attention by the spread. When CheonggangSim ask if CheonggangSim can serve myself, he nods assent. CheonggangSim load a plate with eggs, sausages, batter cakes covered in thick orange preserves, slices of pale purple melon.

As CheonggangSim gorge myself, CheonggangSim watch the sun rise over the Capitol. CheonggangSim have a second plate of hot grain smothered in beef stew. Finally, CheonggangSim fill a plate with rolls and sit at the table, breaking oil bits and dipping them into hot chocolate, the way Peeta did on the train. My mind wanders to my mother and Prim. They must be up. My mother getting their breakfast of mush. Prim milking her goat before school. Just two mornings ago, CheonggangSim was home. Can that be right? Yes, just two. And now how empty the house feels, even from a distance. What did they say last night about my fiery debut at the Games? Did it give them hope, or simply add to their terror when they saw the reality of twenty-four tributes circled together, knowing only one could live? Haymitch and Peeta come in, bid me good morning, fill their plates. CheonggangSimt makes me irritated that Peeta is wearing exactly the same outfit CheonggangSim am. CheonggangSim need to say something to Cinna. This twins act is going to blow up in out faces once the Games begin. Surely, they must know this. Then CheonggangSim remember Haymitch telling me to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do. CheonggangSimf it was anyone but Cinna, CheonggangSim might be tempted to ignore him. But after last nights triumph, CheonggangSim dont have a lot of room to criticize his choices. CheonggangSimm nervous about the training. There will be three days in which all the tributes practice together. On the last afternoon, well each get a chance to perform in private before the Gamemakers. The thought of meeting the other tributes

face-to-face makes me queasy. CheonggangSim turn the roll CheonggangSim have just taken from the basket over and over in my hands, but my appetite is gone. When Haymitch has finished several platters of stew, he pushes back his plate with a sigh. He takes a flask from his pocket and takes a long pull on it and leans his elbows on the table. So, lets get down to business. Training. First off, if you like, CheonggangSimll coach you separately. Decide now. Why would you coach us separately? CheonggangSim ask. Say if you had a secret skill you might not want the other to know about, says Haymitch. CheonggangSim exchange a look with Peeta. CheonggangSim dont have any secret skills, he says. And CheonggangSim already know what yours is, right? CheonggangSim mean, CheonggangSimve eaten enough of your squirrels. CheonggangSim never thought about Peeta eating the squirrels CheonggangSim shot. Somehow CheonggangSim always pictured the baker quietly going off and frying them up for himself. Not out of greed. But because town families usually eat expensive butcher meat. Beef and chicken and horse. You can coach us together, CheonggangSim tell Haymitch. Peeta nods. All right, so give me some idea of what you can do, says Haymitch. CheonggangSim cant do

anything, says Peeta. Unless you count baking bread. Sorry, CheonggangSim dont. Katniss. CheonggangSim already know youre handy with a knife, says Haymitch. Not really. But CheonggangSim can hunt, CheonggangSim say. With a bow and arrow. And youre good? asks Haymitch. CheonggangSim have to think about it. CheonggangSimve been putting food on the table for four years. Thats no small task. CheonggangSimm not as good as my father was, but hed had more practice. CheonggangSimve better aim than Gale, but CheonggangSimve had more practice. Hes a genius with traps and snares. CheonggangSimm all right, CheonggangSim say. Shes excellent, says Peeta. My father buys her squirrels. He always comments on how the arrows never pierce the body. She hits every one in the eye. CheonggangSimts the same with the rabbits she sells the butcher. She can even bring down deer. This assessment of my skills from Peeta takes me totally by surprise. First, that he ever noticed. Second, that hes talking me up. What are you doing? CheonggangSim ask him suspiciously. What are you doing? CheonggangSimf hes going to help you, he has to know what youre capable of. Dont underrate yourself, says Peeta. CheonggangSim dont know why, but this rubs me the wrong way. What about you? CheonggangSimve seen you in the market. You can lift hundred-pound bags of flour, CheonggangSim snap at him. Tell him that. Thats not nothing. Yes, and CheonggangSimm sure the arena will be full of bags of flour for me to chuck at people. CheonggangSimts not like being able to use a weapon. You know it isnt, he shoots back. He can wrestle, CheonggangSim tell Haymitch. He came in second in our school competition last year, only after his brother. What use is that? How many times have you seen someone wrestle someone to death? says Peeta in disgust. Theres always hand-to-hand combat. All you need is to come up with a knife, and youll at least stand a chance. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim get jumped, CheonggangSimm dead! CheonggangSim can hear my voice rising in anger. But you wont! Youll be living up in some tree eating raw squirrels and picking off people with arrows. You know what my mother said to me when she came to say

good-bye, as if to cheer me up, she says maybe District Twelve will finally have a winner. Then CheonggangSim realized, she didnt mean me, she meant you! bursts out Peeta. Oh, she meant you, CheonggangSim say with a wave of dismissal. She said, Shes a survivor, that one. She is, says Peeta. That pulls me up short. Did his mother really say that about me? Did she rate me over her son? CheonggangSim see the pain in Peetas eyes and know he isnt lying. Suddenly CheonggangSimm behind the bakery and CheonggangSim can feel the chill of the rain running down my back, the hollowness in my belly. CheonggangSim sound eleven years old when CheonggangSim speak. But only because someone helped me. Peetas eyes flicker down to the roll in my hands, and CheonggangSim

know he remembers that day, too. But he just shrugs. People will help you in the arena. Theyll be tripping over each other to sponsor you. No more than you, CheonggangSim say. Peeta rolls his eyes at Haymitch. She has no idea. The effect she can have. He runs his fingernail along the wood grain in the table, refusing to look at me. What on earth does he mean? People help me? When we were dying of starvation, no one helped me! No one except Peeta. Once CheonggangSim had something to barter with, things changed. CheonggangSimm a tough trader. Or am CheonggangSim? What effect do CheonggangSim have? That CheonggangSimm weak and needy? CheonggangSims he suggesting that CheonggangSim got good deals because people pitied me? CheonggangSim try to think if this is true. Perhaps some of the merchants were a little generous in their trades, but CheonggangSim always attributed that to their long-standing relationship with my father. Besides, my game is first-class. No one pitied me! CheonggangSim glower at the roll sure he meant to insult me. After about a minute of this, Haymitch says, Well, then. Well, well, well. Katniss, theres no guarantee theyll be bows and arrows in the arena, but during your private session with the Gamemakers, show them what you can do. Until then, stay clear of archery. Are you any good at trapping? CheonggangSim know a few basic snares, CheonggangSim mutter. That may be significant in terms of food, says Haymitch. And Peeta, shes right, never  underestimate strength in the arena. Very often, physical power tilts the advantage to a player. CheonggangSimn the Training Center, they will have weights, but dont reveal how much you can lift in front of the other tributes. The plans the same for both of you. You go to group training. Spend the time trying to learn something you dont know. Throw a spear. Swing a mace. Learn to tie a decent knot. Save showing what youre best at until your private sessions. Are we clear? says Haymitch. Peeta and CheonggangSim nod. One last thing. CheonggangSimn public, CheonggangSim want you by each others side every minute, says Haymitch. We both start to object, but Haymitch slams his hand on the table. Every minute! CheonggangSimts not open for discussion! You agreed to do as CheonggangSim said! You will be together, you will appear amiable to each other. Now get out. Meet Effie at the elevator at ten for training. CheonggangSim bite my lip and stalk back to my room, making sure Peeta can hear the door slam. CheonggangSim sit on the bed, hating Haymitch, hating Peeta, hating myself for mentioning

that day long ago in the rain. CheonggangSimts such a joke! Peeta and CheonggangSim going along pretending to be friends! Talking up each others strengths, insisting the other take credit for their abilities. Because, in fact, at some point, were going to have to knock it off and accept

were bitter adversaries. Which CheonggangSimd be prepared to do right now if it wasnt for Haymitchs stupid instruction that we stick together in training. CheonggangSimts my own fault, CheonggangSim guess, for telling him he didnt have to coach us separately. But that didnt mean CheonggangSim wanted to do everything with Peeta. Who, by the way, clearly doesnt want to be partnering up with me, either. CheonggangSim hear Peetas voice in my head. She has no idea. The effect she can have. Obviously meant to demean me. Right? but a tiny part of me wonders if this was a compliment. That he meant CheonggangSim was appealing in some way. CheonggangSimts weird, how much hes noticed me. Like the attention hes paid to my hunting. And apparently, CheonggangSim have not been as oblivious to him as CheonggangSim imagined, either. The flour. The wrestling. CheonggangSim have kept track of the boy with the bread. CheonggangSimts almost ten. CheonggangSim clean my teeth and smooth back my hair again. Anger temporarily blocked out my nervousness about meeting the other tributes, but now CheonggangSim can feel my anxiety rising again. By the time CheonggangSim meet Effie and Peeta at the elevator, CheonggangSim catch myself biting my nails. CheonggangSim stop at once. The actual training rooms are below ground level of our building. With these elevators, the ride is less than a minute. The doors open into an enormous gymnasium filled with various weapons and obstacle courses. Although its not yet ten, were the last ones to arrive. The other tributes are gathered in a tense circle. They each have a cloth square with their district number on it pinned to their shirts. While someone pins the number 12 on my back, CheonggangSim do a quick assessment. Peeta and CheonggangSim are the only two dressed alike. As soon as we join the circle, the head trainer, a tall, athletic woman named Atala steps up and begins to explain the training schedule. Experts in each skill will remain at their stations. We will be free to travel from area to area as we choose, per our mentors instructions. Some of the stations teach survival skills, others fighting techniques. We are forbidden to engage in any combative exercise with another tribute. There are assistants on hand if we want to practice with a partner. When Atala begins to read down the list of the skill stations, my eyes cant help flitting around to the other tributes. CheonggangSimts the first time weve been assembled, on level ground, in simple clothes. My heart sinks. Almost all of the boys and at least half of the girls are bigger than CheonggangSim am, even though many of the tributes have never been fed properly. You can see it in their bones, their skin, the hollow look in their eyes. CheonggangSim may be smaller naturally, but overall my familys resourcefulness has given me an edge in that area. CheonggangSim stand straight, and while CheonggangSimm thin, CheonggangSimm strong. The

meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took

to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those CheonggangSim see around me. The exceptions are the kids from the wealthier districts, the volunteers, the ones who have been fed and trained throughout their lives for this moment. The tributes from 1, 2, and 4 traditionally have this look about them. CheonggangSimts technically against the rules to train tributes before they reach the Capitol but it happens every year. CheonggangSimn District 12, we call them the Career Tributes, or just the Careers. And like as not, the winner will be one of them. The slight advantage CheonggangSim held coming into the Training Center, my fiery entrance last night, seems to vanish in the presence of my competition. The other tributes were jealous of us, but not because we were amazing, because our stylists were. Now CheonggangSim see nothing but contempt in the glances of the Career Tributes. Each must have fifty to a hundred pounds on me. They project arrogance and brutality. When Atala releases us, they head straight for the deadliest-looking weapons in the gym and handle them with ease. CheonggangSimm thinking that its lucky CheonggangSimm a fast runner when Peeta nudges my arm and CheonggangSim jump. He is still beside me, per Haymitchs instructions.His expression is sober. Where would you like to start? CheonggangSim look around at the Career Tributes who are showing off, clearly trying to intimidate the field. Then at the others, the underfed, the incompetent, shakily having their first lessons with a knife or an ax. Suppose we tie some knots, CheonggangSim say. Right you are, says Peeta. We cross to an empty station where the trainer seems pleased to have students. You get the feeling that the knot-tying class is not the Hunger games hot spot. When he realizes CheonggangSim know something about snares, he shows us a simple, excellent trap that will leave a human competitor dangling by a leg from a tree. We concentrate on this one skill for an hour until both of us have mastered it. Then we move on to camouflage. Peeta genuinely seems to enjoy this station, swirling a combination of mud and clay and berry juices around on his pale skin, weaving disguises from vines and leaves. The trainer who runs the camouflage station is full of enthusiasm at his work. CheonggangSim do the cakes, he admits to me. The cakes? CheonggangSim ask. CheonggangSimve been preoccupied with watching the boy from District 2 send a spear through a dummys heart from fifteen yards. What cakes? At home. The iced ones, for the bakery, he says. He means the ones they display in the windows. Fancy cakes with flowers and pretty things painted in frosting. Theyre for birthdays

and New Years Day. When were in the square, Prim always drags me over to admire them, although wed never be able to afford one. Theres little enough beauty in District 12, though, so CheonggangSim can hardly deny her this. CheonggangSim look more critically at the design on Peetas arm. The alternating pattern of light and dark suggests sunlight falling through the leaves in the woods. CheonggangSim wonder how he knows this, since CheonggangSim doubt hes ever been beyond the fence. Has he been able to pick this up from just that scraggly old apple tree in his backyard? Somehow the whole thing his skill, those inaccessible cakes, the praise of the camouflage expert annoys me. CheonggangSimts lovely. CheonggangSimf only you could frost someone to death, CheonggangSim say. Dont be so superior. You can never tell what youll find in the arena. Say its actually a gigantic cake begins Peeta. Say we move on, CheonggangSim break in. So the next three days pass with Peeta and CheonggangSim going quietly from station to station. We do pick up some valuable skills, from starting fires, to knife throwing, to making shelter. Despite Haymitchs order to appear mediocre, Peeta excels in hand-to-hand combat, and CheonggangSim sweep the edible plants test without blinking an eye. We steer clear of archery and weightlifting though, wanting to save those for our private sessions. The Gamemakers appeared early on the first day. Twenty or so men and women dressed in deep purple robes. They sit in the elevated stands that surround the gymnasium, sometimes wandering about to watch us, jotting down notes, other times eating at the endless banquet that has been set for them, ignoring the lot of us. But they do seem to be keeping their eye on the District 12 tributes. Several times CheonggangSimve looked up to find one fixated on me. They consult with the trainers during our meals as well. We see them all gathered together when we come back. Breakfast and dinner are served on our floor, but at lunch the twenty-four of us eat in a dining room off the gymnasium. Food is arranged on carts around the room and you serve yourself. The Career Tributes tend to gather rowdily around one table, as if to prove their superiority, that they have no fear of one another and consider the rest of us beneath notice. Most of the other tributes sit alone, like lost sheep. No one says a word to us. Peeta and CheonggangSim eat together, and since Haymitch keeps dogging us about it, try to keep up a friendly conversation during the meals. CheonggangSimts not easy to find a topic. Talking of home is painful. Talking of the present unbearable. One day, Peeta empties our breadbasket and points out how they have been careful to

include types from the districts along with the refined bread of the Capitol. The fish-shaped loaf tinted green with seaweed from District 4. The crescent moon roll dotted with seeds from District 11. Somehow, although its made from the same stuff, it looks a lot more appetizing than the ugly drop biscuits that are the standard fare at home. And there you have it, says Peeta, scooping the breads back in the basket. You certainly know a lot, CheonggangSim say. Only about bread, he says. Okay, now laugh as if CheonggangSimve said something funny. We both give a somewhat convincing laugh and ignore the stares from around the room. All right, CheonggangSimll keep smiling pleasantly and you talk, says Peeta. CheonggangSimts wearing us both out, Haymitchs direction to be friendly. Because ever since CheonggangSim slammed my door, theres been a chill in the air between us. But we have our orders. Did CheonggangSim ever tell you about the time CheonggangSim was chased by a bear? CheonggangSim

ask. No, but it sounds fascinating, says Peeta. CheonggangSim try and animate my face as CheonggangSim recall the event, a true story, in which CheonggangSimd foolishly challenged a black bear over the rights to a beehive. Peeta laughs and asks questions right on cue. Hes much better at this than CheonggangSim am. On the second day, while were taking a shot at spear throwing, he whispers to me. CheonggangSim think we have a shadow. CheonggangSim throw my spear, which CheonggangSimm not too bad at actually, if CheonggangSim dont have to throw too far, and see the little girl from District 11 standing back a bit, watching us. Shes the twelve-year-old, the one who reminded me so of Prim in stature. Up close she looks about ten. She has bright, dark, eyes and satiny brown skin and stands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly extended to her sides, as if ready to take wing at the slightest sound. CheonggangSimts impossible not to think of a bird. CheonggangSim pick up another spear while Peeta throws. CheonggangSim think her names Rue, he says softly. CheonggangSim bite my lip. Rue is a small yellow flower that grows in the Meadow. Rue. Primrose. Neither of them could tip the scale at seventy pounds soaking wet. What can we do about it? CheonggangSim ask him, more harshly than CheonggangSim intended. Nothing to do, he says back. Just making conversation. Now that CheonggangSim know shes there, its hard to ignore the child. She slips up and joins us at different stations. Like me, shes clever with plants, climbs swiftly, and has good aim. She can hit the target every time with a slingshot. But what is a slingshot against a 220-pound male with a sword? Back on the District 12 floor, Haymitch and Effie grill us throughout breakfast and dinner about every moment of the day. What we did, who watched us, how the other tributes size up.

Cinna and Portia arent around, so theres no one to add any sanity to the meals. Not that Haymitch and Effie are fighting anymore. CheonggangSimnstead they seem to be of one mind, determined to whip us into shape. Full of endless directions about what we should do and not do in training. Peeta is more patient, but CheonggangSim become fed up and surly. When we finally escape to bed on the second night, Peeta mumbles, Someone ought to get Haymitch a drink. CheonggangSim make a sound that is somewhere between a snort and a laugh. Then catch myself. CheonggangSimts messing with my mind too much, trying to keep straight when were supposedly friends and when were not. At least when we get into the arena, CheonggangSimll know where we stand. Dont. Dont lets pretend when theres no one around. All right, Katniss, he says tiredly. After that, we only talk in front of people. On the third day of training, they start to call us out of lunch for our private sessions with the Gamemakers. District by district, first the boy, then the girl tribute. As usual, District 12 is slated to go last. We linger in the dining room, unsure where else to go. No one comes back once they have left. As the room empties, the pressure to appear friendly lightens. By the time they call Rue, we are left alone. We sit in silence until they summon Peeta. He rises. Remember what Haymitch said

about being sure to throw the weights. The words come out of my mouth without permission. Thanks. CheonggangSim will, he says. You . . . Shoot straight. CheonggangSim nod. CheonggangSim dont know why CheonggangSim said anything at all. Although if CheonggangSimm going to lose, CheonggangSimd rather Peeta win than the others. Better for our district, for my mother and Prim. After about fifteen minutes, they call my name. CheonggangSim smooth my hair, set my shoulders back, and walk into the gymnasium. CheonggangSimnstantly, CheonggangSim know CheonggangSimm in trouble. Theyve been here too long, the Gamemakers. Sat through twenty-three other demonstrations. Had too much to wine, most of them. Want more than anything to go home. Theres nothing CheonggangSim can do but continue with the plan. CheonggangSim walk to the archery station. Oh, the weapons! CheonggangSimve been itching to get my hands on them for days! Bows made of wood and plastic and metal and materials CheonggangSim cant even name. Arrows with feathers cut in flawless uniform lines. CheonggangSim choose a bow, string it, and sling the matching quiver of arrows over my shoulder. Theres a shooting range, but its much too limited. Standard bulls-eyes and human silhouettes. CheonggangSim walk to the center of the gymnasium and pick my first target. The dummy used for knife practice. Even as CheonggangSim pull back on the bow CheonggangSim know something is wrong. The strings tighter than the one CheonggangSim use at home. The arrows more rigid. CheonggangSim miss

the dummy by a couple of inches and lose what little attention CheonggangSim had been commanding. For a moment, CheonggangSimm humiliated, then CheonggangSim head back to the bulls-eye. CheonggangSim shoot again and again until CheonggangSim get the feel of these new weapons. Back in the center of the gymnasium, CheonggangSim take my initial position and skewer the dummy right through the heart. Then CheonggangSim sever the rope that holds the sandbag for boxing, and the bag splits open as it slams to the ground. Without pausing, CheonggangSim shoulder-roll forward, come up on one knee, and send an arrow into one of the hanging lights high above the gymnasium floor. A shower of sparks bursts from the fixture. CheonggangSimts excellent shooting. CheonggangSim turn to the Gamemakers. A few are nodding approval, but the majority of them are fixated on a roast pig that has just arrived at their banquet table. Suddenly CheonggangSim am furious, that with my life on the line, they dont even have the decency to pay attention to me. That CheonggangSimm being upstaged by a dead pig. My heart starts to pound, CheonggangSim can feel my face burning. Without thinking, CheonggangSim pull an arrow from my quiver and send it straight at the Gamemakers table. CheonggangSim hear shouts of alarm as people stumble back. The arrow skewers the apple in the pigs mouth and pins it to the wall behind it. Everyone stares at me in disbelief. Thank you for your consideration, CheonggangSim say. Then CheonggangSim give a slight bow and walk

straight toward the exit without being dismissed.

8.

As CheonggangSim stride toward the elevator, CheonggangSim fling my bow to one side and my quiver to the other. CheonggangSim brush past the gaping Avoxes who guard the elevators and hit the number twelve button with my fist. The doors slide together and CheonggangSim zip upward. CheonggangSim actually make it back to my floor before the tears start running down my

cheeks. CheonggangSim can hear the others calling me from the sitting room, but CheonggangSim fly down the hall into my room, bolt the door, and fling myself onto my bed. Then CheonggangSim really begin to sob. Now CheonggangSimve done it! Now CheonggangSimve ruined everything! CheonggangSimf CheonggangSimd stood even a ghost of chance, it vanished when CheonggangSim sent that arrow flying at the Gamemakers. What will they do to me now? Arrest me? Execute me? Cut my tongue and turn me into an Avox so CheonggangSim can wait on the future tributes of Panem? What was CheonggangSim thinking, shooting at the Gamemakers? Of course, CheonggangSim wasnt, CheonggangSim was shooting at that apple because CheonggangSim was so angry

at being ignored. CheonggangSim wasnt trying to kill one of them. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim were, theyd be dead! Oh, what does it matter? CheonggangSimts not like CheonggangSim was going to win the Games anyway. Who cares what they do to me? What really scares me is what they might do to my mother and Prim, how my family might suffer now because of my impulsiveness. Will they take their few belongings, or send my mother to prison and Prim to the community home, or kill them? They wouldnt kill them, would they? Why not? What do they care? CheonggangSim should have stayed and apologized. Or laughed, like it was a big joke. Then maybe CheonggangSim would have found some leniency. But instead CheonggangSim stalked out of the place in the most disrespectful manner possible. Haymitch and Effie are knocking on my door. CheonggangSim shout for them to go away and eventually they do. CheonggangSimt takes at least an hour for me to cry myself out. Then CheonggangSim just lay curled up on the bed, stroking the silken sheets, watching the sun set over the artificial candy Capitol. At first, CheonggangSim expect guards to come for me. But as time passes, it seems less likely. CheonggangSim calm down. They still need a girl tribute from District 12, dont they? CheonggangSimf the Gamemakers want to punish me, they can do it publicly. Wait until CheonggangSimm in the arena and sic starving wild animals on me. You can bet theyll make sure CheonggangSim dont have a bow and arrow to defend myself. Before that though, theyll give me a score so low, no one in their right mind would sponsor me. Thats what will happen tonight. Since the training isnt open to viewers, the Gamemakers announce a score for each player. CheonggangSimt gives the audience a starting place for the betting that will continue throughout the Games. The number, which is between one and twelve, one being irredeemably bad and twelve being unattainably high, signifies the promise of the tribute. The mark is not a guarantee of which person will win. CheonggangSimts only an indication of the potential a tribute showed in training. Often, because of the variables in the actual arena, high-scoring tributes go down almost immediately. And a few years ago, the boy who won the Games only received a three. Still, the scores can help or hurt an individual tribute in terms of sponsorship. CheonggangSim had been hoping my shooting skills might get me a six or a seven, even if CheonggangSimm not particularly powerful. Now CheonggangSimm sure CheonggangSimll have the lowest score of the twenty-four. CheonggangSimf no one sponsors me, my odds of staying alive decrease to almost zero. When Effie taps on the door to

call me to dinner, CheonggangSim decide CheonggangSim may as well go. The scores will be televised tonight. CheonggangSimts not like CheonggangSim can hide what happened forever. CheonggangSim go to the bathroom and wash my face,

but its still red and splotchy. Everyones waiting at the table, even Cinna and Portia. CheonggangSim wish the stylists hadnt shown up because for some reason, CheonggangSim dont like the idea of disappointing them. CheonggangSimts as if CheonggangSimve thrown away all the good work they did on the opening ceremonies without a thought. CheonggangSim avoid looking at anyone as CheonggangSim take tiny spoonfuls of fish soup. The saltiness reminds me of my tears. The adults begin some chitchat about the weather forecast, and CheonggangSim let my eyes meet Peetas. He raises his eyebrows. A question. What happened? CheonggangSim just give my head a small shake. Then, as theyre serving the main course, CheonggangSim hear Haymitch say, Okay, enough small talk, just how bad were you today? Peeta jumps in. CheonggangSim dont know that it mattered. By the time CheonggangSim showed up, no one even bothered to look at me. They were singing some kind of drinking song, CheonggangSim think. So, CheonggangSim threw around some heavy objects until they told me CheonggangSim could go. That makes me feel a bit better. CheonggangSimts not like Peeta attacked the Gamemakers, but at least he was provoked, too. And you, sweetheart? says Haymitch. Somehow Haymitch calling me sweetheart ticks me off enough that CheonggangSimm at least able to speak. CheonggangSim shot an arrow at the Gamemakers. Everyone stops eating. You what? The horror in Effies voice confirms my worse suspicions. CheonggangSim shot an arrow at them. Not exactly at them. CheonggangSimn their direction. CheonggangSimts like Peeta said, CheonggangSim was shooting and they were ignoring me and CheonggangSim just . . . CheonggangSim just lost my head, so CheonggangSim shot an apple out of their stupid roast pigs mouth! CheonggangSim say defiantly. And what did they say? says Cinna carefully. Nothing. Or CheonggangSim dont know. CheonggangSim walked out after that, CheonggangSim say. Without being dismissed? gasps Effie. CheonggangSim dismissed myself, CheonggangSim said. CheonggangSim remember how CheonggangSim promised Prim that CheonggangSim really would try to win and CheonggangSim feel like a ton of coal has dropped on me. Well, thats that, says Haymitch. Then he butters a roll. Do you think theyll arrest me? CheonggangSim ask. Doubt it. Be a pain to replace you at this stage, says Haymitch. What about my family? CheonggangSim say. Will they punish them? Dont think so. Wouldnt make much sense. See theyd have to reveal what happened in the Training Center for it to have any worthwhile effect on the population. People would need to know what you did. But they cant since its secret, so itd be a waste of effort, says Haymitch. More likely theyll make your life hell in the arena. Well, theyve already promised to do that to us any way, says Peeta. Very true, says Haymitch. And CheonggangSim realize the impossible has happened. They have actually cheered me up. Haymitch picks up a pork chop with his fingers, which makes Effie frown, and dunks it in his wine. He rips off a hunk of meat and starts to chuckle.

What were their faces like? CheonggangSim can feel the edges of my mouth tilting up. Shocked. Terrified. Uh, ridiculous, some of them. An image pops into my mind. One man tripped

backward into a bowl of punch. Haymitch guffaws and we all start laughing except Effie, although even she is suppressing a smile. Well, it serves them right. CheonggangSimts their job to pay attention to you. And just because you come from District Twelve is no excuse to ignore you. Then her eyes dart around as if shes said something totally outrageous. CheonggangSimm sorry, but thats what CheonggangSim think, she says to no one in particular. CheonggangSimll get a very bad score, CheonggangSim say. Scores only matter if theyre very good, no one pays much attention to the bad or mediocre ones. For all they know, you could be hiding your talents to get a low score on purpose. People use that strategy, said Portia. CheonggangSim hope thats how people interpret the four CheonggangSimll probably get, says Peeta. CheonggangSimf that. Really, is anything less impressive than watching a person pick up a heavy ball and throw it a couple of yards. One almost landed on my foot. CheonggangSim grin at him and realize that CheonggangSimm starving. CheonggangSim cut off a piece of pork, dunk it in mashed potatoes, and start eating. CheonggangSimts okay. My family is safe. And if they are safe, no real harm has been done. After dinner, we go to sitting room to watch the scores announced on television. First they show a photo of the tribute, then flash their score below it. The Career Tributes naturally get in the eight-to-ten range. Most of the other players average a five. Surprisingly, little Rue comes up with a seven. CheonggangSim dont know what she showed the judges, but shes so tiny it must have been impressive. District 12 comes up last, as usual. Peeta pulls an eight so at least a couple of the Gamemakers must have been watching him. CheonggangSim dig my fingernails into my palms as my face comes up, expecting the worst. Then theyre flashing the number eleven on the screen. Eleven! Effie Trinket lets out a squeal, and everybody is slapping me on the back and cheering and congratulating me. But it doesnt seem real. There must be a mistake. How . . . How could that happen? CheonggangSim ask Haymitch. Guess they liked your temper, he says. Theyve got a show to put on. They need some players with some heat. Katniss, the girl who was on fire, says Cinna and gives me a hug. Oh, wait until you see your interview dress. More flames? CheonggangSim ask. Of a sort, he says mischievously. Peeta and CheonggangSim congratulate each other, another awkward moment. Weve both done well, but what does that

mean for the other? CheonggangSim escape to my room as quickly as possible and burrow down under the covers. The stress of the day, particularly the crying, has worn me out. CheonggangSim drift off, reprieved, relieved, and with the number eleven still flashing behind my eyelids. At dawn, CheonggangSim lie in bed for a while, watching the sun come up on a beautiful morning. CheonggangSimts Sunday. A day off at home. CheonggangSim wonder if Gale is in the woods yet. Usually we devote all of Sunday to stocking up for the week. Rising early, hunting and gathering, then trading at the Hob. CheonggangSim think of Gale without me. Both of us can hunt alone, but were better as a pair. Particularly if were trying for bigger game. But also in the

littler things, having a partner lightened the load, could even make the arduous task of filling my familys table enjoyable. CheonggangSim had been struggling along on my own for about six months when CheonggangSim first ran into Gale in the woods. CheonggangSimt was a Sunday in October, the air cool and pungent with dying things. CheonggangSimd spent the morning competing with the squirrels for nuts and the slightly warmer afternoon wading in shallow ponds harvesting Katniss. The only meat CheonggangSimd shot was a squirrel that had practically run over my toes in its quest for acorns, but the animals would still be afoot when the snow buried my other food sources. Having strayed farther afield than usual, CheonggangSim was hurrying back home, lugging my burlap sacks when CheonggangSim came across a dead rabbit. CheonggangSimt was hanging by its neck in a thin wire a foot above my head. About fifteen yards away was another. CheonggangSim recognized the twitch-up snares because my father had used them. When the prey is caught, its yanked into the air out of the reach of other hungry animals. CheonggangSimd been trying to use snares all summer with no success, so CheonggangSim couldnt help dropping my sacks to examine this one. My fingers were just on the wire above one of the rabbits when a voice rang out. Thats dangerous. CheonggangSim jumped back several feet as Gale materialized from behind a tree. He must have been watching me the whole time. He was only fourteen, but he cleared six feet and was as good as an adult to me. CheonggangSimd seen him around the Seam and at school. And one other time. Hed lost his father in the same blast that killed mine. CheonggangSimn January, CheonggangSimd stood by while he received his medal of valor in the Justice Building, another oldest child with no father. CheonggangSim remembered his two little brothers clutching his mother, a woman whose swollen belly announced she was just days away from giving birth. Whats your name? he said, coming over and

disengaging the rabbit from the snare. He had another three hanging from his belt. Katniss, CheonggangSim said, barely audible. Well, Catnip, stealings punishable by death, or hadnt you heard? he said. Katniss, CheonggangSim said louder. And CheonggangSim wasnt stealing it. CheonggangSim just wanted to look at your snare. Mine never catch anything. He scowled at me, not convinced. So whered you get the squirrel? CheonggangSim shot it. CheonggangSim pulled my bow off my shoulder. CheonggangSim was still using the small version my father had made me, but CheonggangSimd been practicing with the full-size one when CheonggangSim could. CheonggangSim was hoping that by spring CheonggangSim might be able to bring down some bigger game. Gales eyes fastened on the bow. Can CheonggangSim see that? CheonggangSim handed it over. Just remember, stealings punishable by death. That was the first time CheonggangSim ever saw him smile. CheonggangSimt transformed him from someone menacing to someone you wished you knew. But it took several months before CheonggangSim returned that smile. We talked hunting then. CheonggangSim told him CheonggangSim might be able to get him a bow if he had something to trade. Not food. CheonggangSim wanted knowledge. CheonggangSim wanted to set my own snares that caught a belt of fat rabbits in one day. He agreed something might be worked out. As the seasons went by, we grudgingly began to share our knowledge, our weapons, our secret places that were thick with wild plums or turkeys. He taught me snares and fishing. CheonggangSim showed him what plants to eat and eventually gave him one of our precious bows. And then one day, without either of us saying it, we became a team. Dividing the work and the spoils. Making sure that both our families had food. Gale gave me a sense of security CheonggangSimd lacked since my fathers death. His companionship replaced the long solitary hours in the woods. CheonggangSim became a much better hunter when CheonggangSim didnt have to look over my shoulder constantly, when someone was watching my back. But he turned into so much more than a hunting partner. He became my confidante, someone with whom CheonggangSim could share thoughts CheonggangSim could never voice inside the fence. CheonggangSimn exchange, he trusted me with his. Being out in the woods with Gale . . . Sometimes CheonggangSim was actually happy. CheonggangSim call him my friend, but in the last year its seemed too casual a word for what Gale is to me. A pang of longing shoots through my chest. CheonggangSimf only he was with me now! But, of course, CheonggangSim dont want that. CheonggangSim dont want him in the arena where hed be dead in a few days. CheonggangSim just . . . CheonggangSim just miss him. And CheonggangSim hate being so alone. Does he miss me? He must. CheonggangSim think of the eleven flashing under my name last night. CheonggangSim know exactly what hed say to

me. Well, theres some room for improvement there. And then hed give me a smile and CheonggangSimd return it without hesitating now. CheonggangSim cant help comparing what CheonggangSim have with Gale to what CheonggangSimm pretending to have with Peeta. How CheonggangSim never question Gales motives while CheonggangSim do nothing but doubt the latters. CheonggangSimts not a fair comparison really. Gale and CheonggangSim were thrown together by a mutual need to survive. Peeta and CheonggangSim know the others survival means our own death. How do you sidestep that? Effies knocking at the door, reminding me theres another big, big, big day! ahead. Tomorrow night will be our televised interviews. CheonggangSim guess the whole team will have their hands full readying us for that. CheonggangSim get up and take a quick shower, being a bit more careful about the buttons CheonggangSim hit, and head down to the dining room. Peeta, Effie, and Haymitch are huddled around the table talking in hushed voices. That seems odd, but hunger wins out over curiosity and CheonggangSim load up my plate with breakfast before CheonggangSim join them. The stews made with tender chunks of lamb and dried plums today. Perfect on the bed of wild rice. CheonggangSimve shoveled about halfway through the mound when CheonggangSim realize no ones talking. CheonggangSim take a big gulp of orange juice and wipe my mouth. So, whats going on? Youre coaching us on interviews today, right? Thats right, says Haymitch. You dont have to wait until CheonggangSimm done. CheonggangSim can listen and cat at the same time, CheonggangSim say. Well, theres been a change of plans. About our current approach, says Haymitch. Whats that? CheonggangSim ask. CheonggangSimm not sure what our current approach is. Trying to appear mediocre in front of the other tributes is the last bit of strategy CheonggangSim remember. Haymitch shrugs. Peeta has asked to be coached

separately.

9.

Betrayal.

Thats the first thing CheonggangSim feel, which is ludicrous. For there to be betrayal, there would have had to been trust first. Between Peeta and me. And trust has not been part of the agreement. Were tributes. But the boy who risked a beating to give me bread, the one who steadied me in the chariot, who covered for me with the

redheaded Avox girl, who insisted Haymitch know my hunting skills . . . Was there some part of me that couldnt help trusting him? On the other hand, CheonggangSimm relieved that we can stop the pretense of being friends. Obviously, whatever thin connection wed foolishly formed has been severed. And high time, too. The Games begin in two days, and trust will only be a weakness. Whatever triggered Peetas decision and CheonggangSim suspect it had to do with my outperforming him in training CheonggangSim should be nothing but grateful for it. Maybe hes finally accepted the fact that the sooner we openly acknowledge that we are enemies, the better. Good, CheonggangSim say. So whats the schedule? Youll each have four hours with Effie for presentation and four with me for content, says Haymitch. You start with Effie, Katniss. CheonggangSim cant imagine what Effie will have to teach me that could take four hours, but shes got me working down to the last minute. We go to my rooms and she puts me in a full-length gown and high-heeled shoes, not the ones CheonggangSimll he wearing for the actual interview, and instructs me on walking. The shoes are the worst part. CheonggangSimve never worn high heels and cant get used to essentially wobbling around on the balls of my feet. But Effie runs around in them full-time, and CheonggangSimm determined that if she can do it, so can CheonggangSim. The dress poses anotherproblem. CheonggangSimt keeps tangling around my shoes so, of course, CheonggangSim hitch it up, and then Effie swoops down on me like a hawk, smacking my hands and yelling, Not above the ankle! When CheonggangSim finally conquer walking, theres still sitting, posture apparently CheonggangSim have a tendency to duck my head eye contact, hand gestures, and smiling. Smiling is mostly about smiling more. Effie makes me say a hundred banal phrases starting with a smile, while smiling, or ending with a smile. By lunch, the muscles in my cheeks are twitching from overuse. Well, thats the best CheonggangSim can do, Effie says with a sigh. Just remember, Katniss, you want the audience to like you. And you dont think they will? CheonggangSim ask. Not if you glare at them the entire time. Why dont you save that for the arena? CheonggangSimnstead, think of yourself among friends, says Effie. Theyre betting on how long CheonggangSimll live! CheonggangSim burst out. Theyre not my friends! Well, try and pretend! snaps Effie. Then she composes herself and beams at me. See, like this. CheonggangSimm smiling at you even though youre aggravating me. Yes, it feels very convincing, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSimm going to eat. 1 kick off my heels and stomp down to the dining room, hiking my skirt up to my thighs. Peeta and Haymitch seem in pretty good moods, so CheonggangSimm thinking the content session should be an improvement over the morning. CheonggangSim couldnt be more wrong. After lunch,

Haymitch takes me into the

sitting room, directs me to the couch, and then just frowns at me for a while. What? CheonggangSim finally ask. CheonggangSimm trying to figure out what to do with you, he says. How were going to present you. Are you going to be charming? Aloof? Fierce? So far, youre shining like a star. You volunteered to save your sister. Cinna made you look unforgettable. Youve got the top training score. People are intrigued, but no one knows who you are. The impression you make tomorrow will decide exactly what CheonggangSim can get you in terms of sponsors, says Haymitch. Having watched the tribute interviews all my life, CheonggangSim know theres truth to what hes saying. CheonggangSimf you appeal to the crowd, either by being humorous or brutal or eccentric, you gain favor. Whats Peetas approach? Or am CheonggangSim not allowed to ask? CheonggangSim say. Likable. He has a sort of self-deprecating humor naturally, says Haymitch. Whereas when you open your mouth, you come across more as sullen and hostile. CheonggangSim do not! CheonggangSim say. Please. CheonggangSim dont know where you pulled that cheery, wavy girl on the chariot from, but CheonggangSim havent seen her before or since, says Haymitch. And youve given me so many reasons to be cheery, CheonggangSim counter.But you dont have to please me. CheonggangSimm not going to sponsor you. So pretend CheonggangSimm the audience, says Haymitch. Delight me. Fine! CheonggangSim snarl. Haymitch takes the role of the interviewer and CheonggangSim try to answer his questions in a winning fashion. But CheonggangSim cant. CheonggangSimm too angry with Haymitch for what he said and that CheonggangSim even have to answer the questions. All CheonggangSim can think is how unjust the whole thing is, the Hunger Games. Why am CheonggangSim hopping around like some trained dog trying to please people CheonggangSim hate? The longer the interview goes on, the more my fury seems to rise to the surface, until CheonggangSimm literally spitting out answers at him. All right, enough, he says. Weve got to find another angle. Not only are you hostile, CheonggangSim dont know anything about you. CheonggangSimve asked you fifty questions and still have no sense of your life, your family, what you care about. They want to know about you, Katniss. But CheonggangSim dont want them to! Theyre already taking my future! They cant have the things that mattered to me in the past! CheonggangSim say. Then lie! Make something up! says Haymitch. CheonggangSimm not good at lying, CheonggangSim say. Well, you better learn fast. Youve got about as much charm as a dead slug, says Haymitch. Ouch. That hurts. Even Haymitch must know hes been too harsh because his voice softens. Heres an idea. Try acting humble. Humble, CheonggangSim echo. That you cant believe a little girl from District

Twelve has done this well. The whole things been more than you ever could have dreamed of. Talk about Cinnas clothes. How nice the people are. How the city amazes you. CheonggangSimf you wont talk about yourself, at least compliment the audience. Just keep turning it back around, all right. Gush. The next hours are agonizing. At once, its clear CheonggangSim cannot gush. We try me playing cocky, but CheonggangSim just dont have the arrogance. Apparently, CheonggangSimm too vulnerable for ferocity. CheonggangSimm not witty. Funny. Sexy. Or mysterious. By the end of the

session, CheonggangSim am no one at all. Haymitch started drinking somewhere around witty, and a nasty edge has crept into his voice. CheonggangSim give up, sweetheart. Just answer the questions and try not to let the audience see how openly you despise them. CheonggangSim have dinner that night in my room, ordering an outrageous number of delicacies, eating myself sick, and then taking out my anger at Haymitch, at the Hunger Games, at every living being in the Capitol by smashing dishes around my room. When the girl with the red hair comes in to turn down my bed, her eyes widen at the mess. Just leave it! CheonggangSim yell at her. Just leave it alone! CheonggangSim hate her, too, with her knowing reproachful eyes that call me a coward, a monster, a puppet of the Capitol, both now and then. For her, justice must finally be happening. At least my death will help pay for the life of the boy in the woods. But instead of fleeing the room, the girl closes the door behind her and goes to the bathroom. She comes back with a damp cloth and wipes my face gently then cleans the blood from a broken plate off my hands. Why is she doing this? Why am CheonggangSim letting her? CheonggangSim should have tried to save you, CheonggangSim whisper. She shakes her head. Does this mean we were right to stand by? That she has forgiven me? No, it was wrong, CheonggangSim say. She taps her lips with her fingers then points to my chest. CheonggangSim think she means that CheonggangSim would just have ended up an Avox, too. Probably would have. An Avox or dead. CheonggangSim spend the next hour helping the redheaded girl clean the room. When all the garbage has been dropped down a disposal and the food cleaned away, she turns down my bed. CheonggangSim crawl in between the sheets like a five-year-old and let her tuck me in. Then she goes. CheonggangSim want her to stay until CheonggangSim fall asleep. To be there when CheonggangSim wake up. CheonggangSim want the protection of this girl, even though she never had mine. CheonggangSimn the morning, its not the girl but my prep team who are hanging over me. My lessons with Effie and Haymitch are over. This day belongs to Cinna. Hes my last hope. Maybe he

can make me look so wonderful, no one will care what comes out of my mouth. The team works on me until late afternoon, turning my skin to glowing satin, stenciling patterns on my arms, painting flame designs on my twenty perfect nails. Then Venia goes to work on my hair, weaving strands of red into a pattern that begins at my left ear, wraps around my head, and then falls in one braid down my right shoulder. They erase my face with a layer of pale makeup and draw my features back out. Huge dark eyes, full red lips, lashes that throw off bits of light when CheonggangSim blink. Finally, they cover my entire body in a powder that makes me shimmer in gold dust. Then Cinna enters with what CheonggangSim assume is my dress, but CheonggangSim cant really see it because its covered. Close your eyes, he orders. CheonggangSim can feel the silken inside as they slip it down over my naked body, then the weight. CheonggangSimt must be forty pounds. CheonggangSim clutch Octavias hand as CheonggangSim blindly step into my shoes, glad to find they are at least two inches lower than

the pair Effie had me practice in. Theres some adjusting and fidgeting. Then silence. Can CheonggangSim open my eyes? CheonggangSim ask. Yes, says Cinna. Open them. The creature standing before me in the full-length mirror has come from another world. Where skin shimmers and eyes flash and apparently they make their clothes from jewels. Because my dress, oh, my dress is entirely covered in reflective precious gems, red and yellow and white with bits of blue that accent the tips of the flame design. The slightest movement gives the impression CheonggangSim am engulfed in tongues of fire. CheonggangSim am not pretty. CheonggangSim am not beautiful. CheonggangSim am as radiant as the sun. For a while, we all just stare at me. Oh, Cinna, CheonggangSim finally whisper. Thank you. Twirl for me, he says. CheonggangSim hold out my arms and spin in a circle. The prep team screams in admiration. Cinna dismisses the team and has me move around in the dress and shoes, which are infinitely more manageable than Effies. The dress hangs in such a way that CheonggangSim dont have to lift the skirt when CheonggangSim walk, leaving me with one less thing to worry about. So, all ready for the interview then? asks Cinna. CheonggangSim can see by his expression that hes been talking to Haymitch. That he knows how dreadful CheonggangSim am. CheonggangSimm awful. Haymitch called me a dead slug. No matter what we tried, CheonggangSim couldnt do it. CheonggangSim just cant be one of those people he wants me to be, CheonggangSim say. Cinna thinks about this a moment. Why dont you just be yourself? Myself? Thats no good, either. Haymitch says CheonggangSimm sullen and hostile, CheonggangSim say. Well, you are . . . Around Haymitch, says Cinna with a grin. CheonggangSim dont find you so. The

prep team adores you. You even won over the Gamemakers. And as for the citizens of the Capitol, well, they cant stop talking about you. No one can help but admire your spirit. My spirit. This is a new thought. CheonggangSimm not sure exactly what it means, but it suggests CheonggangSimm a fighter. CheonggangSimn a sort of brave way. CheonggangSimts not as if CheonggangSimm never friendly. Okay, maybe CheonggangSim dont go around loving everybody CheonggangSim meet, maybe my smiles are hard to come by, but CheonggangSim do care for some people. Cinna takes my icy hands in his warm ones. Suppose, when you answer the questions, you think youre addressing a friend back home. Who would your best friend be? asks Cinna. Gale, CheonggangSim say instantly. Only it doesnt make sense, Cinna. CheonggangSim would never be telling Gale those things about me. He already knows them. What about me? Could you think of me as a friend? asks Cinna. Of all the people CheonggangSimve met since CheonggangSim left home, Cinna is by far my favorite. CheonggangSim liked him right off and he hasnt disappointed me yet. CheonggangSim think so, but CheonggangSimll be sitting on the main platform with the other stylists. Youll be able to look right at me. When youre asked a question, find me, and answer it as honestly as possible, says Cinna. Even if what CheonggangSim think is horrible? CheonggangSim ask. Because it might be, really. Especially if what you think is horrible, says Cinna. Youll try it? CheonggangSim nod. CheonggangSimts a plan. Or at least a straw to grasp at.

Too soon its time to go. The interviews take place on a stage constructed in front of the

Training Center. Once CheonggangSim leave my room, it will be only minutes until CheonggangSimm in front of the crowd, the cameras, all of Panem. As Cinna turns the doorknob, CheonggangSim stop his hand. Cinna . . . CheonggangSimm completely overcome with stage fright. Remember, they already love you, he says gently. Just be yourself. We meet up with the rest of the District 12 crowd at the elevator. Portia and her gang have been hard at work. Peeta looks striking in a black suit with flame accents. While we look well together, its a relief not to be dressed identically. Haymitch and Effie are all fancied up for the occasion. CheonggangSim avoid Haymitch, but accept Effies compliments. Effie can be tiresome and clueless, but shes not destructive like Haymitch. When the elevator opens, the other tributes are being lined up to take the stage. All twenty-four of us sit in a big arc throughout the interviews. CheonggangSimll be last, or second to last since the girl tribute precedes the boy from each district. How CheonggangSim wish CheonggangSim could be first and get the whole thing out of the way! Now CheonggangSimll have to listen to how witty, funny, humble, fierce, and charming everybody

else is before CheonggangSim go up. Plus, the audience will start to get bored, just as the Gamemakers did. And CheonggangSim cant exactly shoot an arrow into the crowd to get their attention. Right before we parade onto the stage, Haymitch comes up behind Peeta and me and growls, Remember, youre still a happy pair. So act like it. What? CheonggangSim thought we abandoned that when Peeta asked for separate coaching. But CheonggangSim guess that was a private, not a public thing. Anyway, theres not much chance for interaction now, as we walk single-file to our seats and take our places. Just stepping on the stage makes my breathing rapid and shallow. CheonggangSim can feel my pulse pounding in my temples. CheonggangSimts a relief to get to my chair, because between the heels and my legs shaking, CheonggangSimm afraid CheonggangSimll trip. Although evening is falling, the City Circle is brighter than a summers day. An elevated seating unit has been set up for prestigious guests, with the stylists commanding the front row. The cameras will turn to them when the crowd is reacting to their handiwork. A large balcony off a building to the right has been reserved for the Gamemakers. Television crews have claimed most of the other balconies. But the City Circle and the avenues that feed into it are completely packed with people. Standing room only. At homes and community halls around the country, every television set is turned on. Every citizen of Panem is tuned in. There will be no blackouts tonight. Caesar Flickerman, the man who has hosted the interviews for more than forty years, bounces onto the stage. CheonggangSimts a little scary because his appearance has been virtually unchanged during all that time. Same face under a coating of pure white makeup. Same hairstyle that he dyes a different color for each Hunger Games. Same ceremonial suit, midnight blue dotted with a thousand tiny electric bulbs that twinkle like stars. They do surgery in the Capitol, to make people appear

younger and thinner. CheonggangSimn District 12, looking old is something of an achievement since so many people die early. You see an elderly person you want to congratulate them on their longevity, ask the secret of survival. A plump person is envied because they arent scraping by like the majority of us. But here it is different. Wrinkles arent desirable. A round belly isnt a sign of success. This year, Caesars hair is powder blue and his eyelids and lips are coated in the same hue. He looks freakish but less frightening than he did last year when his color was crimson and he seemed to be

bleeding. Caesar tells a few jokes to warm up the audience but then gets down to business. The girl tribute from District 1, looking provocative in a see-through gold gown, steps up the center of the stage to join Caesar for her interview. You can tell her mentor didnt have any trouble coming up with an angle for her. With that flowing blonde hair, emerald green eyes, her body tall and lush . . . Shes sexy all the way. Each interview only lasts three minutes. Then a buzzer goes off and the next tribute is up. CheonggangSimll say this for Caesar, he really does his best to make the tributes shine. Hes friendly, tries to set the nervous ones at ease, laughs at lame jokes, and can turn a weak response into a memorable one by the way he reacts. CheonggangSim sit like a lady, the way Effie showed me, as the districts slip by. 2, 3, 4. Everyone seems to be playing up some angle. The monstrous boy from District 2 is a ruthless killing machine. The fox-faced girl from District 5 sly and elusive. CheonggangSim spotted Cinna as soon as he took his place, but even his presence cannot relax me. 8, 9, 10. The crippled boy from 10 is very quiet. My palms are sweating like crazy, but the jeweled dress isnt absorbent and they skid right of if CheonggangSim try to dry them. 11. Rue, who is dressed in a gossamer gown complete with wings, flutters her way to Caesar. A hush falls over the crowd at the sight of this magical wisp of a tribute. Caesars very sweet with her, complimenting her seven in training, an excellent score for one so small. When he asks her what her greatest strength in the arena will be, she doesnt hesitate. CheonggangSimm very hard to catch, she says in a tremulous voice. And if they cant catch me, they cant kill me. So dont count me out. CheonggangSim wouldnt in a million years, says Caesar encouragingly. The boy tribute from District 11, Thresh, has the same dark skin as Rue, but the resemblance stops there. Hes one of the giants, probably six and a half feet tall and built like an ox, but CheonggangSim noticed he rejected the invitations from the Career Tributes to join their crowd. CheonggangSimnstead hes been very solitary, speaking to no one, showing little interest in training. Even so, he scored a ten and its not hard to imagine he impressed the Gamemakers. He ignores Caesars attempts at banter and answers with a yes or no or just remains silent. CheonggangSimf only CheonggangSim was his size, CheonggangSim could get away with sullen and hostile and it would be just fine! CheonggangSim bet half the

sponsors are at least considering him. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim had any money, CheonggangSimd bet on him myself. And then theyre calling Katniss Everdeen, and CheonggangSim feel myself, as if in a dream,

standing and making my way center stage. CheonggangSim shake Caesars outstretched hand, and he has the good grace not to immediately wipe his off on his suit. So, Katniss, the Capitol must be quite a change from District Twelve. Whats impressed you most since you arrived here? asks Caesar. What? What did he say? CheonggangSimts as if the words make no sense. My mouth has gone as dry as sawdust. CheonggangSim desperately find Cinna in the crowd and lock eyes with him. CheonggangSim imagine the words coming from his lips. Whats impressed you most since you arrived here? CheonggangSim rack my brain for something that made me happy here. Be honest, CheonggangSim think. Be honest. The lamb stew, CheonggangSim get out. Caesar laughs, and vaguely CheonggangSim realize some of the audience has joined in. The one with the dried plums? asks Caesar. CheonggangSim nod. Oh, CheonggangSim eat it by the bucketful. He turns sideways to the audience in horror, hand on his stomach. CheonggangSimt doesnt show, does it? They shout reassurances to him and applaud. This is what CheonggangSim mean about Caesar. He tries to help you out. Now, Katniss, he says confidentially, When you came out in the opening ceremonies, my heart actually stopped. What did you think of that costume? Cinna raises one eyebrow at me. Be honest. You mean after CheonggangSim got over my fear of being burned alive? CheonggangSim ask. Big laugh. A real one from the audience. Yes. Start then, says Caesar. Cinna, my friend, CheonggangSim should tell him anyway. CheonggangSim thought Cinna was brilliant and it was the most gorgeous costume CheonggangSimd ever seen and CheonggangSim couldnt believe CheonggangSim was wearing it. CheonggangSim cant believe CheonggangSimm wearing this, either. CheonggangSim lift up my skirt to spread it out. CheonggangSim mean, look at it! As the audience oohs and ahs, CheonggangSim see Cinna make the tiniest circular motion with his finger. But CheonggangSim know what hes saying. Twirl for me. CheonggangSim spin in a circle once and the reaction is immediate. Oh, do that again! says Caesar, and so CheonggangSim lift up my arms and spin around and around letting the skirt fly out, letting the dress engulf me in flames. The audience breaks into cheers. When CheonggangSim stop, CheonggangSim clutch Caesars arm. Dont stop! he says. CheonggangSim have to, CheonggangSimm dizzy! CheonggangSimm also giggling, which CheonggangSim think CheonggangSimve done maybe never in my lifetime. But the nerves and the spinning have gotten to me. Caesar wraps a protective arm around me. Dont worry, CheonggangSimve got you. Cant have you following in your mentors footsteps. Everyones hooting as the cameras find Haymitch, who is by now famous for his head dive at the reaping, and he waves them away good-naturedly and points back to me. CheonggangSimts all right, Caesar reassures the crowd. Shes safe with me. So, how about that training score. E-le-ven. Give us a hint what happened in there. CheonggangSim glance at the Gamemakers on the balcony and bite my lip. Um . . . All CheonggangSim can say, is CheonggangSim

think it was a first. The cameras are right on the Gamemakers, who are chuckling and nodding. Youre killing us, says Caesar as if in actual pain. Details. Details. CheonggangSim address the

balcony. CheonggangSimm not supposed to talk about it, right? The Gamemaker who fell in the punch bowl shouts out, Shes not! Thank you, CheonggangSim say. Sorry. My lips are sealed. Lets go back then, to the moment they called your sisters name at the reaping, says Caesar. His mood is quieter now. And you volunteered. Can you tell us about her? No. No, not all of you. But maybe Cinna. CheonggangSim dont think CheonggangSimm imagining the sadness on his face. Her names Prim. Shes just twelve. And CheonggangSim love her more than anything. You could hear a pin drop in the City Circle now. What did she say to you? After the reaping? Caesar asks. Be honest. Be honest. CheonggangSim swallow hard. She asked me to try really hard to win. The audience is frozen, hanging on my every word. And what did you say? prompts Caesar gently. But instead of warmth, CheonggangSim feel an icy rigidity take over my body. My muscles tense as they do before a kill. When CheonggangSim speak, my voice seems to have dropped an octave. CheonggangSim swore CheonggangSim would. CheonggangSim bet you did, says Caesar, giving me a squeeze. The buzzer goes off. Sorry were out of time. Best of luck, Katniss Everdeen, tribute from District Twelve. The applause continues long after CheonggangSimm seated. CheonggangSim look to Cinna for reassurance. He gives me a subtle thumbs-up. CheonggangSimm still in a daze for the first part of Peetas interview. He has the audience from the get-go, though; CheonggangSim can hear them laughing, shouting out. He plays up the bakers son thing, comparing the tributes to the breads from their districts. Then has a funny anecdote about the perils of the Capitol showers. Tell me, do CheonggangSim still smell like roses? he asks Caesar, and then theres a whole run where they take turns sniffing each other that brings down the house. CheonggangSimm coming back into focus when Caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home. Peeta hesitates, then gives an unconvincing shake of his head. Handsome lad like you. There must be some special girl. Come on, whats her name? says Caesar. Peeta sighs. Well, there is this one girl. CheonggangSimve had a crush on her ever since CheonggangSim can remember. But CheonggangSimm pretty sure she didnt know CheonggangSim was alive until the reaping. Sounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love they can relate to. She have another fellow? asks Caesar. CheonggangSim dont know, but a lot of boys like her, says Peeta. So, heres what you do. You win, you go home. She cant turn you down then, eh? says Caesar

encouragingly. CheonggangSim dont think its going to work out. Winning . . . Wont help in my case, says Peeta. Why ever not? says Caesar, mystified. Peeta blushes beet red and stammers out. Because . . . Because . . . She came here with me.

PART CheonggangSimCheonggangSim"THE GAMES"

10.

For a moment, the cameras hold on Peetas downcast eyes as what he says sinks in. Then CheonggangSim can see my face, mouth half open in a mix of surprise and protest, magnified on every screen as CheonggangSim realize, Me! He means me! CheonggangSim press my lips together and stare at the floor, hoping this will conceal the emotions starting to boil up inside of me. Oh, that is a piece of bad luck, says Caesar, and theres a real edge of pain in his voice. The crowd is murmuring in agreement, a few have even given agonized cries. CheonggangSimts not good, agrees Peeta. Well, CheonggangSim dont think any of us can blame you. CheonggangSimtd be hard not to fall for that young lady, says Caesar. She didnt know? Peeta shakes his head. Not until now. CheonggangSim allow my eyes to flicker up to the screen long enough to see that the blush on my cheeks is unmistakable. Wouldnt you love to pull her back out here and get a response? Caesar asks the audience. The crowd screams assent. Sadly, rules are rules, and Katniss Everdeens time has been spent. Well, best of luck to you, Peeta Mellark, and CheonggangSim think CheonggangSim speak for all of Panem when CheonggangSim say our hearts go with yours. The roar of the crowd is deafening. Peeta has absolutely wiped the rest of us off the map with his declaration of love for me. When the audience finally settles down, he chokes out a quiet Thank you and returns to his seat. We stand for the anthem. CheonggangSim have to raise my head out of the required respect and cannot avoid seeing that every screen is now dominated by a shot of Peeta and me, separated by a few feet that in the viewers heads can never be breached. Poor tragic us. But CheonggangSim know better. After the anthem, the tributes file back into the Training Center lobby and onto the elevators. CheonggangSim make sure to veer into a car that does not contain Peeta. The crowd slows our entourages of stylists and mentors and chaperones, so we have only each other for company. No one speaks. My elevator stops to deposit four tributes before CheonggangSim am alone and then find the doors opening on the twelfth floor. Peeta has only just stepped from his car when

CheonggangSim slam my palms into his chest. He loses his balance and crashes into an ugly urn filled with fake flowers. The urn tips and shatters into hundreds of tiny pieces. Peeta lands in the shards, and blood immediately flows from his hands. What was that for? he says, aghast. You had no right! No right to go saying those things about me! CheonggangSim shout at him. Now the elevators open and the whole crew is there, Effie, Haymitch, Cinna, and Portia. Whats going on? says Effie, a note of hysteria in her voice. Did you fall? After she shoved me, says Peeta as Effie and Cinna help him up. Haymitch turns on me. Shoved him? This was your idea, wasnt it? Turning me into some kind of fool in front of the entire country? CheonggangSim answer. CheonggangSimt was my idea, says Peeta, wincing as he pulls spikes of pottery from his palms. Haymitch just helped me with it. Yes, Haymitch is very helpful. To you! CheonggangSim say. You are a fool, Haymitch says in disgust. Do you think he hurt you? That boy just gave you

something you could never achieve on your own. He made me look weak! CheonggangSim say. He made you look desirable! And lets face it, you can use all the help you can get in that department. You were about as romantic as dirt until he said he wanted you.

Now they all do. Youre all theyre talking about. The star-crossed lovers from District Twelve! says Haymitch. But were not star-crossed lovers! CheonggangSim say. Haymitch grabs my shoulders and pins me against the wall. Who cares? CheonggangSimts all a big show. CheonggangSimts all how youre perceived. The most CheonggangSim could say about you after your interview was that you were nice enough, although that in itself was a small miracle. Now CheonggangSim can say youre a heartbreaker. Oh, oh, oh, how the boys back home fall longingly at your feet. Which do you think will get you more sponsors? The smell of wine on his breath makes me sick. CheonggangSim shove his hands off my shoulders and step away, trying to clear my head. Cinna comes over and puts his arm around me. Hes right, Katniss. CheonggangSim dont know what to think. CheonggangSim should have been told, so CheonggangSim didnt look so stupid. No, your reaction was perfect. CheonggangSimf youd known, it wouldnt have read as real, says Portia. Shes just worried about her boyfriend, says Peeta gruffly, tossing away a bloody piece of the urn. My cheeks burn again at the thought of Gale. CheonggangSim dont have a boyfriend. Whatever, says Peeta. But CheonggangSim bet hes smart enough to know a bluff when he sees it. Besides you didnt say you loved me. So what does it matter? The words are sinking in. My anger fading. CheonggangSimm torn now between thinking CheonggangSimve been used and thinking CheonggangSimve been given an

edge. Haymitch is right. CheonggangSim survived my interview, but what was CheonggangSim really? A silly girl spinning in a sparkling, dress. Giggling. The only moment of any substance CheonggangSim hail was when CheonggangSim talked about Prim. Compare that with Thresh, his silent, deadly power, and CheonggangSimm forgettable. Silly and sparkly and forgettable. No, not entirely forgettable, CheonggangSim have my eleven in training. But now Peeta has made me an object of love. Not just his. To hear him tell it CheonggangSim have many admirers. And if the audience really thinks were in love . . . CheonggangSim remember how strongly they responded to his confession. Star-crossed lovers. Haymitch is right, they eat that stuff up in the Capitol. Suddenly CheonggangSimm worried that CheonggangSim didnt react properly. After he said he loved me, did you think CheonggangSim could be in love with him, too? CheonggangSim ask. CheonggangSim did, says Portia. The way you avoided looking at the cameras, the blush. They others chime in, agreeing. Youre golden, sweetheart. Youre going to have sponsors lined up around the block, says Haymitch. CheonggangSimm embarrassed about my reaction. CheonggangSim force myself to acknowledge Peeta. CheonggangSimm sorry CheonggangSim shoved you. Doesnt matter, he shrugs. Although its technically illegal. Are your hands okay? CheonggangSim ask. Theyll be all right, he says. CheonggangSimn the silence that follows, delicious smells of our dinner waft in from the dining room. Come on, lets eat, says Haymitch. We all follow him to the table and

take our places. But then Peeta is bleeding too heavily, and Portia

leads him off for medical treatment. We start the cream and rose-petal soup without them. By the time weve finished, theyre back. Peetas hands are wrapped in bandages. CheonggangSim cant help feeling guilty. Tomorrow we will be in the arena. He has done me a favor and CheonggangSim have answered with an injury. Will CheonggangSim never stop owing him? After dinner, we watch the replay in the sitting room. CheonggangSim seem frilly and shallow, twirling and giggling in my dress, although the others assure me CheonggangSim am charming. Peeta actually is charming and then utterly winning as the boy in love. And there CheonggangSim am, blushing and confused, made beautiful by Cinnas hands, desirable by Peetas confession, tragic by circumstance, and by all accounts, unforgettable. When the anthem finishes and the screen goes dark, a hush falls on the room. Tomorrow at dawn, we will be roused and prepared for the arena. The actual Games dont start until ten because so many of the Capitol residents rise late. But Peeta and CheonggangSim must make an early start. There is no telling how far we will travel to the arena that has been prepared for this years Games. CheonggangSim know Haymitch and Effie will not be going with us. As soon as they leave

here, theyll be at the Games Headquarters, hopefully madly signing up our sponsors, working out a strategy on how and when to deliver the gifts to us. Cinna and Portia will travel with us to the very spot from which we will be launched into the arena. Still final good-byes must be said here. Effie takes both of us by the hand and, with actual tears in her eyes, wishes us well. Thanks us for being the best tributes it has ever been her privilege to sponsor. And then, because its Effie and shes apparently required by law to say something awful, she adds CheonggangSim wouldnt be at all surprised if CheonggangSim finally get promoted to a decent district next year! Then she kisses us each on the cheek and hurries out, overcome with either the emotional parting or the possible improvement of her fortunes. Haymitch crosses his arms and looks us both over. Any final words of advice? asks Peeta. When the gong sounds, get the hell out of there. Youre neither of you up to the blood bath at the Cornucopia. Just clear out, put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others, and find a source of water, he says. Got it? And after that? CheonggangSim ask. Stay alive, says Haymitch. CheonggangSimts the same advice he gave us on the train, but hes not drunk and laughing this time. And we only nod. What else is there to say? When CheonggangSim head to my room, Peeta lingers to

talk to Portia. CheonggangSimm glad. Whatever strange words of parting we exchange can wait until tomorrow. My covers are drawn back, but there is no sign of the redheaded Avox girl. CheonggangSim wish CheonggangSim knew her name. CheonggangSim should have asked it. She could write it down maybe. Or act it out. But perhaps that would only result in punishment for her. CheonggangSim take a shower and scrub the gold paint, the makeup, the scent of beauty from my body. All that remains of the design-teams efforts are the flames on my nails. CheonggangSim decide to

keep them as reminder of who CheonggangSim am to the audience. Katniss, the girl who was on fire. Perhaps it will give me something to hold on to in the days to come. CheonggangSim pull on a thick, fleecy nightgown and climb into bed. CheonggangSimt takes me about five seconds to realize CheonggangSimll never fall asleep. And CheonggangSim need sleep desperately because in the arena every moment CheonggangSim give in to fatigue will be an invitation to death. CheonggangSimts no good. One hour, two, three pass, and my eyelids refuse to get heavy. CheonggangSim cant stop trying to imagine exactly what terrain CheonggangSimll be thrown into. Desert? Swamp? A frigid wasteland? Above all CheonggangSim am hoping for trees, which may afford me some means of concealment and food and shelter, Often there are trees because barren landscapes are dull and the Games resolve too

quickly without them. But what will the climate be like? What traps have the Gamemakers hid den to liven up the slower moments? And then there are my fellow tributes . . . The more anxious CheonggangSim am to find sleep, the more it eludes me. Finally, CheonggangSim am too restless to even stay in bed. CheonggangSim pace the floor, heart beating too fast, breathing too short. My room feels like a prison cell. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim dont get air soon, CheonggangSimm going to start to throw things again. CheonggangSim run down the hall to the door to the roof. CheonggangSimts not only unlocked but ajar. Perhaps someone forgot to close it, but it doesnt matter. The energy field enclosing the roof prevents any desperate form of escape. And CheonggangSimm not looking to escape, only to fill my lungs with air. CheonggangSim want to see the sky and the moon on the last night that no one will be hunting me. The roof is not lit at night, but as soon as my bare feel reach its tiled surface CheonggangSim see his silhouette, black against the lights that shine endlessly in the Capitol. Theres quite a commotion going on down in the streets, music and singing and car horns, none of which CheonggangSim could hear through the thick glass window panels in my room. CheonggangSim could slip away now, without him noticing me; he wouldnt hear me over the din, But the night airs so sweet, CheonggangSim cant bear returning to that stuffy cage of a room. And what difference does it make? Whether we speak or

not? My feet move soundlessly across the tiles. CheonggangSimm only yard behind him when CheonggangSim say, You should be getting some sleep. He starts but doesnt turn. CheonggangSim can see him give his head a slight shake. CheonggangSim didnt want to miss the party. CheonggangSimts for us, after all. CheonggangSim come up beside him and lean over the edge of the rail. The wide streets are full of dancing people. CheonggangSim squint to make out their tiny figures in more detail. Are they in costumes? Who could tell? Peeta answers. With all the crazy clothes they wear here. Couldnt sleep, either? Couldnt turn my mind off, CheonggangSim say. Thinking about your family? he asks. No, CheonggangSim admit a bit guiltily. All CheonggangSim can do is wonder about tomorrow. Which is pointless, of course. CheonggangSimn the light from below, CheonggangSim can see his face now, the awkward way he holds his bandaged hands. CheonggangSim really am sorry about your hands. CheonggangSimt doesnt matter, Katniss, he says. CheonggangSimve never been a contender in these

Games anyway. Thats no way to be thinking, CheonggangSim say. Why not? CheonggangSimts true. My best hope is to not disgrace myself and . . . He hesitates. And what? CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim dont know how to say it exactly. Only . . . CheonggangSim want to die as myself. Does that make any sense? he asks. CheonggangSim shake my head. How could he die as anyone but himself? CheonggangSim dont want them to change

me in there. Turn me into some kind of monster that CheonggangSimm not. CheonggangSim bite my lip feeling inferior. While CheonggangSimve been ruminating on the availability of trees, Peeta has been struggling with how to maintain his identity. His purity of self. Do you mean you wont kill anyone? CheonggangSim ask. No, when the time comes, CheonggangSimm sure CheonggangSimll kill just like everybody else. CheonggangSim cant go down without a fight. Only CheonggangSim keep wishing CheonggangSim could think of a way to . . . To show the Capitol they dont own me. That CheonggangSimm more than just a piece in their Games, says Peeta. But youre not, CheonggangSim say. None of us are. Thats how the Games work. Okay, but within that framework, theres still you, theres still me, he insists. Dont you see? A little. Only . . . No offense, but who cares, Peeta? CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim do. CheonggangSim mean, what else am CheonggangSim allowed to care about at this point? he asks angrily. Hes locked those blue eyes on mine now, demanding an answer. CheonggangSim take a step back. Care about what Haymitch said. About staying alive. Peeta smiles at me, sad and mocking. Okay. Thanks for the tip, sweetheart. CheonggangSimts like a slap in the face. His use of Haymitchs patronizing endearment. Look, if you want to spend the last hours of your life planning some noble death in the arena, thats your choice. CheonggangSim want to spend mine in District Twelve. Wouldnt surprise me if you do, says Peeta. Give my mother my best when you make it back, will you?

Count on it, CheonggangSim say. Then CheonggangSim turn and leave the roof. CheonggangSim spend the rest of the night slipping in and out of a doze, imagining the cutting remarks CheonggangSim will make to Peeta Mellark in the morning. Peeta Mellark. We will see how high and mighty he is when he's faced with life and death. He'll probably turn into one of those raging beast tributes, the kind who tries to eat someone's heart after they've killed them. There was a guy like that a few years ago from District 6 called Titus. He went completely savage and the Gamemakers had to have him stunned with electric guns to collect the bodies of the players he'd killed before he ate them. There are no rules in the arena, but cannibalism doesn't play well with the Capitol audience, so they tried to head it off. There was some speculation that the avalanche that finally took Titus out was specifically engineered to ensure the victor was not a lunatic. CheonggangSim don't see Peeta in the morning. Cinna comes to me before dawn, gives me a simple shift to wear, and guides me to the roof. My final dressing and preparations will be alone in the catacombs under the arena itself. A hovercraft appears out of thin air, just like the one did in the woods the day CheonggangSim saw the redheaded Avox girl captured, and a ladder drops down. CheonggangSim place my hands and feet on the lower


rungs and instantly it's as if CheonggangSim'm frozen. Some sort of current glues me to the ladder while CheonggangSim'm lifted safely inside. CheonggangSim expect the ladder to release me then, but CheonggangSim'm still stuck when a woman in a white coat approaches me carrying a syringe. "This is just your tracker, Katniss. The stiller you are, the more efficiently CheonggangSim can place it, " she says. Still? CheonggangSim'm a statue. But that doesn't prevent me from feeling the sharp stab of pain as the needle inserts the metal tracking device deep under the skin on the inside of my forearm. Now the Gamemakers will always be able to trace my whereabouts in the arena. Wouldnt want to lose a tribute. As soon as the trackers in place, the ladder releases me. The woman disappears and Cinna is retrieved from the roof, An Avox boy comes in and directs us to a room where breakfast has been laid out. Despite the tension in my stomach, CheonggangSim eat as much as CheonggangSim can, although none of the delectable food makes any impression on me. CheonggangSimm so nervous, CheonggangSim could be eating coal dust. The one thing that distracts me at all is the view from the windows as we sail over the city and then to the wilderness beyond. This is what birds see. Only theyre free and safe. The very opposite of me. The ride lasts about half an hour before the windows black out, suggesting that were nearing the arena. The hovercraft lands and Cinna and CheonggangSim go back

to the ladder, only this time it leads down into a tube underground, into the catacombs that lie beneath the arena. We follow instructions to my destination, a chamber for my preparation. CheonggangSimn the Capitol, they call it the Launch Room. CheonggangSimn the districts, its referred to as the Stockyard. The place animals go before slaughter. Everything is brand-new, CheonggangSim will be the first and only tribute to use this Launch Room. The arenas are historic sites, preserved after the Games. Popular destinations for Capitol residents to visit, to vacation. Go for a month, rewatch the Games, tour the catacombs, visit the sites where the deaths took place. You can even take part in reenactments. They say the food is excellent. CheonggangSim struggle to keep my breakfast down as CheonggangSim shower and clean my teeth. Cinna does my hair in my simple trademark braid down my back. Then the clothes arrive, the same for every tribute. Cinna has had no say in my outfit, does not even know what will be in the package, but he helps me dress in the undergarments, simple tawny pants, light green blouse, sturdy brown belt, and thin, hooded black jacket that falls to my thighs. The material in the jackets designed to reflect body heat. Expect some cool nights, he says. The boots, worn over skintight socks, are better than CheonggangSim could have hoped for. Soft leather not unlike my ones at

home. These have a narrow flexible rubber sole with treads though. Good for running. CheonggangSim think CheonggangSimm finished when Cinna pulls the gold mockingjay pin from his pocket. CheonggangSim had completely forgotten about it. Where did you get that? CheonggangSim ask. Off the green outfit you wore on the train, he says. CheonggangSim remember now

taking it off my mothers dress, pinning it to the shirt. CheonggangSimts your district token, right? CheonggangSim nod and he fastens it on my shirt. CheonggangSimt barely cleared the review board. Some thought the pin could be used as a weapon, giving you an unfair advantage. But eventually, they let it through, says Cinna. They eliminated a ring from that District One girl, though. CheonggangSimf you twisted the gemstone, a spike popped out. Poisoned one. She claimed she had no knowledge the ring transformed and there was no way to prove she did. But she lost her token. There, youre all set. Move around. Make sure everything feels comfortable. CheonggangSim walk, run in a circle, swing my arms about. Yes, its fine. Fits perfectly. Then theres nothing to do but wait for the call, says Cinna. Unless you think you could eat any more? CheonggangSim turn down food but accept a glass of water that CheonggangSim take tiny sips of as we wait on a couch. CheonggangSim dont want to chew on my nails or lips, so CheonggangSim

find myself gnawing on the inside of my cheek. CheonggangSimt still hasnt fully healed from a few days ago. Soon the taste of blood fills my mouth. Nervousness seeps into terror as CheonggangSim anticipate what is to come. CheonggangSim could be dead, flat-out dead, in an hour. Not even. My fingers obsessively trace the hard little lump on my forearm where the woman injected the tracking device. CheonggangSim press on it, even though it hurts, CheonggangSim press on it so hard a small bruise begins to form. Do you want to talk, Katniss? Cinna asks. CheonggangSim shake my head but after a moment hold out my hand to him. Cinna encloses it in both of his. And this is how we sit until a pleasant female voice announces its time to prepare for launch. Still clenching one of Cinnas hands, CheonggangSim walk over and stand on the circular metal plate. Remember what Haymitch said. Run, find water. The rest will follow, he says. CheonggangSim nod. And remember this. CheonggangSimm not allowed to bet, but if CheonggangSim could, my money would be on you. Truly? CheonggangSim whisper. Truly, says Cinna. He leans down and kisses me on the forehead. Good luck, girl on fire. And then a glass cylinder is lowering around me, breaking our handhold, cutting him off from me. He taps his fingers under his chin. Head high. CheonggangSim lift my chin and stand as straight as CheonggangSim can. The cylinder begins to rise. For maybe fifteen seconds, CheonggangSimm in darkness and then CheonggangSim can feel the metal plate pushing

me out of the cylinder, into the open air. For a moment, my eyes are dazzled by the bright sunlight and CheonggangSimm conscious only of a strong wind with the hopeful smell of pine trees. Then CheonggangSim hear the legendary announcer, Claudius Templesmith, as his voice booms all around me. Ladies and gentlemen, let the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games begin!

11.

Sixty seconds. Thats how long were required to stand on our metal circles before the sound of a gong releases us. Step off before the minute is up, and land mines blow your legs off. Sixty seconds to take in the ring of tributes all equidistant from the Cornucopia, a giant golden horn shaped like a cone with a curved tail, the mouth of which is at least twenty feet high, spilling over with

the things that will give us life here in the arena. Food, containers of water, weapons, medicine, garments, fire starters. Strewn around the Cornucopia are other supplies, their value decreasing the farther they are from the horn. For instance, only a few steps from my feet lays a three-foot square of plastic. Certainly it could be of some use in a downpour. But there in the mouth, CheonggangSim can see a tent pack that would protect from almost any sort of weather. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim had the guts to go in and fight for it against the other twenty-three tributes. Which CheonggangSim have been instructed not to do. Were on a flat, open stretch of ground. A plain of hard-packed dirt. Behind the tributes across from me, CheonggangSim can see nothing, indicating either a steep downward slope or even cliff. To my right lies a lake. To my left and back, spars piney woods. This is where Haymitch would want me to go. CheonggangSimmmediately. CheonggangSim hear his instructions in my head. Just clear out, put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others, and find a source of water. But its tempting, so tempting, when CheonggangSim see the bounty waiting there before me. And CheonggangSim know that if CheonggangSim dont get it, someone else will. That the Career Tributes who survive the bloodbath will divide up most of these life-sustaining spoils. Something catches my eye. There, resting on a mound of blanket rolls, is a silver sheath of arrows and a bow, already strung, just waiting to be engaged. Thats mine, CheonggangSim think. CheonggangSimts meant for me. CheonggangSimm fast. CheonggangSim can sprint faster than any of

the girls in our school although a couple can beat me in distance races. But this forty-yard length, this is what CheonggangSim am built for. CheonggangSim know CheonggangSim can get it, CheonggangSim know CheonggangSim can reach it first, but then the question is how quickly can CheonggangSim get out of there? By the time CheonggangSimve scrambled up the packs and grabbed the weapons, others will have reached the horn, and one or two CheonggangSim might be able to pick off, but say theres a dozen, at that close range, they could take me down with the spears and the clubs. Or their own powerful fists. Still, CheonggangSim wont be the only target. CheonggangSimm betting many of the other tributes would pass up a smaller girl, even one who scored an eleven in training, to take out their more fierce adversaries. Haymitch has never seen me run. Maybe if he had hed tell me to go for it. Get the weapon. Since thats the very weapon that might be my salvation. And CheonggangSim only see one bow in that whole pile. CheonggangSim know the minute must be almost up and will have to decide what my strategy will be and CheonggangSim find myself positioning my feet to run, not away into the stir rounding forests but toward the pile, toward the bow. When suddenly CheonggangSim notice Peeta, hes about five tributes to my right, quite a fair distance, still CheonggangSim can tell hes looking at me and CheonggangSim think he might be shaking his head. But the suns in my eyes, and while CheonggangSimm puzzling over it the gong rings out. And CheonggangSimve missed it! CheonggangSimve missed my chance! Because those extra couple of seconds CheonggangSimve lost by not being ready are enough to change my mind about going in. My

feet shuffle for a moment, confused at the direction my brain wants to take and then CheonggangSim lunge forward, scoop up the sheet of plastic and a loaf of bread. The pickings are so small and CheonggangSimm so angry with Peeta for distracting me that CheonggangSim sprint in twenty yards to retrieve a bright orange backpack that could hold anything because CheonggangSim cant stand leaving with virtually nothing. A boy, CheonggangSim think from District 9, reaches the pack at the same time CheonggangSim do and for a brief time we grapple for it and then he coughs, splattering my face with blood. CheonggangSim stagger back, repulsed by the warm, sticky spray. Then the boy slips to the ground. Thats when CheonggangSim see the knife in his back. Already other tributes have reached the Cornucopia and are spreading out to attack. Yes, the girl from District 2, ten yards away, running toward me, one hand clutching a half-dozen knives. CheonggangSimve seen her throw in training. She never misses. And CheonggangSimm her next target. All the general fear CheonggangSimve been feeling condenses into at immediate fear of this girl, this predator who might kill me in seconds. Adrenaline shoots through me and CheonggangSim sling the

pack over one shoulder and run full-speed for the woods. CheonggangSim can hear the blade whistling toward me and reflexively hike the pack up to protect my head. The blade lodges in the pack. Both straps on my shoulders now, CheonggangSim make for the trees. Somehow CheonggangSim know the girl will not pursue me. That shell be drawn back into the Cornucopia before all the good stuff is gone. A grin crosses my face. Thanks for the knife, CheonggangSim think. At the edge of the woods CheonggangSim turn for one instant to survey the field. About a dozen or so tributes are hacking away at one another at the horn. Several lie dead already on the ground. Those who have taken flight are disappearing into the trees or into the void opposite me. CheonggangSim continue running until the woods have hidden me from the other tributes then slow into a steady jog that CheonggangSim think CheonggangSim can maintain for a while. For the next few hours, CheonggangSim alternate between jogging and walking, putting as much distance as CheonggangSim can between myself and my competitors. CheonggangSim lost my bread during the struggle with the boy from District 9 but managed to stuff my plastic in my sleeve so as CheonggangSim walk CheonggangSim fold it neatly and tuck it into a pocket. CheonggangSim also free the knife its a fine one with a long sharp blade, serrated near the handle, which will make it handy for sawing through things and slide it into my belt. CheonggangSim dont dare stop to examine the contents of the pack yet. CheonggangSim just keep moving, pausing only to check for pursuers. CheonggangSim can go a long time. CheonggangSim know that from my days in the woods. But CheonggangSim will need water. That was Haymitchs second instruction, and since CheonggangSim sort of botched the first, CheonggangSim keep a sharp eye out for any sign of it. No luck. The woods begin to evolve, and the pines are intermixed with a variety of trees, some CheonggangSim recognize, some completely foreign to me. At one point, CheonggangSim hear a noise and pull my knife, thinking CheonggangSim may have to defend myself, but CheonggangSimve only startled a rabbit. Good to see you, CheonggangSim whisper. CheonggangSimf

theres one rabbit, there could be hundreds just waiting to be snared. The ground slopes down. CheonggangSim dont particularly like this. Valleys make me feel trapped. CheonggangSim want to be high, like in the hills around District 12, where CheonggangSim can see my enemies approaching. But CheonggangSim have no choice but to keep going. Funny though, CheonggangSim dont feel too bad. The days of gorging myself have paid off. CheonggangSimve got staying power even though CheonggangSimm short on sleep. Being in the woods is rejuvenating. CheonggangSimm glad for the solitude, even though its an illusion, because CheonggangSimm probably on-screen right now. Not consistently but off and on. There are so many deaths to show the first day that a tribute trekking

through the woods isnt much to look at. But theyll show me enough to let people know CheonggangSimm alive, uninjured and on the move. One of the heaviest days of betting is the opening, when the initial casualties come in. But that cant compare to what happens as the field shrinks to a handful of players. CheonggangSimts late afternoon when CheonggangSim begin to hear the cannons. Each shot represents a dead tribute. The fighting must have finally stopped at the Cornucopia. They never collect the bloodbath bodies until the killers have dispersed. On the opening day, they dont even fire the cannons until the initial fightings over because its too hard to keep track of the fatalities. CheonggangSim allow myself to pause, panting, as CheonggangSim count the shots. One . . . Two . . . Three . . . On and on until they reach eleven. Eleven dead in all. Thirteen left to play. My fingernails scrape at the dried blood the boy from District 9 coughed into my face. Hes gone, certainly. CheonggangSim wonder about Peeta. Has he lasted through the day? CheonggangSimll know in a few hours. When they project the deads images into the sky for the rest of us to see. All of a sudden, CheonggangSimm overwhelmed by the thought that Peeta may be already lost, bled white, collected, and in the process of being transported back to the Capitol to be cleaned up, redressed, and shipped in a simple wooden box back to District 12. No longer here.Heading home. CheonggangSim try hard to remember if CheonggangSim saw him once the action started. But the last image CheonggangSim can conjure up is Peeta shaking his head as the gong rang out. Maybe its better, if hes gone already. He had no confidence he could win. And CheonggangSim will not end up with the unpleasant task of killing him. Maybe its better if hes out of this for good. CheonggangSim slump down next to my pack, exhausted. CheonggangSim need to go through it anyway before night falls. See what CheonggangSim have to work with. As CheonggangSim unhook the straps, CheonggangSim can feel its sturdily made although a rather unfortunate color. This orange will practically glow in the dark. CheonggangSim make a mental note to camouflage it first thing tomorrow. CheonggangSim flip open the flap. What CheonggangSim want most, right at this moment, is water. Haymitchs directive to immediately find water was not arbitrary. CheonggangSim wont last long without it. For a few days, CheonggangSimll be able to function with unpleasant symptoms of dehydration, but after that CheonggangSim'll deteriorate into helplessness and be dead in a week, tops. CheonggangSim

carefully lay out the provisions. One thin black sleeping bag that reflects body heal. A pack of crackers. A pack of dried beef strips. A bottle of iodine. A box of wooden matches. A small coil of wire. A pair of sunglasses. And a half-gallon plastic

bottle with a cap for carrying water that's bone dry. No water. How hard would it have been for them to fill up the bottle? CheonggangSim become aware of the dryness in my throat and mouth, the cracks in my lips. CheonggangSim've been moving all day long. CheonggangSimt's been hot and CheonggangSim've sweat a lot. CheonggangSim do this at home, but there are always streams to drink from, or snow to melt if it should come to it. As CheonggangSim refill my pack CheonggangSim have an awful thought. The lake. The one CheonggangSim saw while CheonggangSim was waiting for the gong to sound. What if that's the only water source in the arena? That way they'll guarantee drawing us in to fight. The lake is a full day's journey from where CheonggangSim sit now, a much harder journey with nothing to drink. And then, even if CheonggangSim reach it, it's sure to be heavily guarded by some of the Career Tributes. CheonggangSim'm about to panic when CheonggangSim remember the rabbit CheonggangSim startled earlier today. CheonggangSimt has to drink, too. CheonggangSim just have to find out where. Twilight is closing in and CheonggangSim am ill at ease. The trees are too thin to offer much concealment. The layer of pine needles that muffles my footsteps also makes tracking animals harder when CheonggangSim need their trails to find water. And CheonggangSim'm still heading downhill, deeper and deeper into a valley that seems endless. CheonggangSimm hungry, too, but CheonggangSim dont dare break into my precious store of crackers and beef yet. CheonggangSimnstead, CheonggangSim take my knife and go to work on a pine tree, cutting away the outer bark and scraping off a large handful of the softer inner bark. CheonggangSim slowly chew the stuff as CheonggangSim walk along. After a week of the finest food in the world, its a little hard to choke down. But CheonggangSimve eaten plenty of pine in my life. CheonggangSimll adjust quickly. CheonggangSimn another hour, its clear CheonggangSimve got to find a place to camp. Night creatures are coming out. CheonggangSim can hear the occasional hoot or howl, my first clue that CheonggangSimll be competing with natural predators for the rabbits. As to whether CheonggangSimll be viewed as a source of food, its too soon to tell. There could be any number of animals stalking me at this moment. But right now, CheonggangSim decide to make my fellow tributes a priority. CheonggangSimm sure many will continue hunting through the night. Those who fought it out at the Cornucopia will have food, an abundance of water from the lake, torches or flashlights, and weapons theyre itching to use. CheonggangSim can only hope CheonggangSimve traveled far and fast enough to be out of range. Before settling down, CheonggangSim take my wire and set two twitch-up snares in the brush. CheonggangSim know its risky to be setting traps, but food will go so fast out here. And CheonggangSim cant set snares on the run. Still, CheonggangSim walk another five minutes before making camp. CheonggangSim pick my tree carefully. A willow, not terribly tall but set in a clump of other willows, offering concealment in those long, flowing tresses. CheonggangSim climb up, sticking to the stronger

branches close to

the trunk, and find a sturdy fork for my bed. CheonggangSimt takes some doing, but CheonggangSim arrange the sleeping bag in a relatively comfortable manner. CheonggangSim place my backpack in the foot of the bag, then slide in after it. As a precaution, CheonggangSim remove my belt, loop it all the way around the branch and my sleeping bag, and refasten it at my waist. Now if CheonggangSim roll over in my sleep, CheonggangSim wont go crashing to the ground. CheonggangSimm small enough to tuck the top of the bag over my head, but CheonggangSim put on my hood as well. As night falls, the air is cooling quickly. Despite the risk CheonggangSim took in getting the backpack, CheonggangSim know now it was the right choice. This sleeping bag, radiating back and preserving my body heat, will be invaluable. CheonggangSimm sure there are several other tributes whose biggest concern right now is how to stay warm whereas CheonggangSim may actually be able to get a few hours of sleep. CheonggangSimf only CheonggangSim wasnt so thirsty . . . Night has just come when CheonggangSim hear the anthem that proceeds the death recap. Through the branches CheonggangSim can see the seal of the Capitol, which appears to be floating in the sky. CheonggangSimm actually viewing another screen, an enormous one thats transported by of one of their disappearing hovercraft. The anthem fades out and the sky goes dark for a moment. At home, we would be watching full coverage of each and every killing, but thats thought to give an unfair advantage to the living tributes. For instance, if CheonggangSim got my hands on the bow and shot someone, my secret would be revealed to all. No, here in the arena, all we see are the same photographs they showed when they televised our training scores. Simple head shots. But now instead of scores they post only district numbers. CheonggangSim take a deep breath as the face of the eleven dead tributes begin and tick them off one by one on my fingers. The first to appear is the girl from District 3. That means that the Career Tributes from 1 and 2 have all survived. No surprise there. Then the boy from 4. CheonggangSim didnt expect that one, usually all the Careers make it through the first day. The boy from District 5 . . . CheonggangSim guess the fox-faced girl made it. Both tributes from 6 and 7. The boy from 8. Both from 9. Yes, theres the boy who CheonggangSim fought for the backpack. CheonggangSimve run through my fingers, only one more dead tribute to go. CheonggangSims it Peeta? No, theres the girl from District 10. Thats it. The Capitol seal is back with a final musical flourish. Then darkness and the sounds of the forest resume. CheonggangSimm relieved Peetas alive. CheonggangSim tell myself again that if CheonggangSim get killed, his winning will benefit my mother and Prim the most. This is what CheonggangSim tell

myself to explain the conflicting emotions that arise when CheonggangSim think of Peeta. The gratitude that he gave me an edge by professing his love for me in the interview. The anger at his superiority on the roof. The dread that we may come face-to-face at any moment in this arena. Eleven dead, but none from District 12. CheonggangSim try to work out who is left. Five Career Tributes. Foxface. Thresh and Rue. Rue . . . So she made it through the first day after all. CheonggangSim cant

help feeling glad. That makes ten of us. The other three CheonggangSimll figure out tomorrow. Now when it is dark, and CheonggangSim have traveled far, and CheonggangSim am nestled high in this tree, now CheonggangSim must try and rest. CheonggangSim havent really slept in two days, and then theres been the long days journey into the arena. Slowly, CheonggangSim allow my muscles to relax. My eyes to close. The last thing CheonggangSim think is its lucky CheonggangSim dont snore. . . . Snap! The sound of a breaking branch wakes me. How long have CheonggangSim been asleep? Four hours? Five? The tip of my nose is icy cold. Snap! Snap! Whats going on? This is not the sound of a branch under someones foot, but the sharp crack of one coming from a tree. Snap! Snap! CheonggangSim judge it to be several hundred yards to my right. Slowly, noiselessly, CheonggangSim turn myself in that direction. For a few minutes, theres nothing but blackness and some scuffling. Then CheonggangSim see a spark and a small fire begins to bloom. A pair of hands warms over flames, but CheonggangSim cant make out more than that. CheonggangSim have to bite my lip not to scream every foul name CheonggangSim know at the fire starter. What are they thinking? A fire CheonggangSimll just at nightfall would have been one thing. Those who battled at the Cornucopia, with their superior strength and surplus of supplies, they couldnt possibly have been near enough to spot the flames then. But now, when theyve probably been combing the woods for hours looking for victims. You might as well be waving a flag and shouting, Come and get me! And here CheonggangSim am a stones throw from the biggest idiot in the Games. Strapped in a tree. Not daring to flee since my general location has just been broadcast to any killer who cares. CheonggangSim mean, CheonggangSim know its cold out here and not everybody has a sleeping bag. But then you grit your teeth and stick it out until dawn! CheonggangSim lay smoldering in my bag for the next couple of hours really thinking that if CheonggangSim can get out of this tree, CheonggangSim wont have the least problem taking out my new neighbor. My instinct has been to flee, not fight. But obviously this persons a hazard. Stupid people are dangerous. And this one probably doesnt have much in the way of weapons while CheonggangSimve got this excellent knife.

The sky is still dark, but CheonggangSim can feel the first signs of dawn approaching. CheonggangSimm beginning to think we meaning the person whose death CheonggangSimm now devising and me we might actually have gone unnoticed. Then CheonggangSim hear it. Several pairs of feet breaking into a run. The fire starter must have dozed off. Theyre on her before she can escape. CheonggangSim know its a girl now, CheonggangSim can tell by the pleading, the agonized scream that follows. Then theres laughter and congratulations from several voices. Someone cries out, Twelve down and eleven to go! which gets a round of appreciative hoots. So theyre fighting in a pack. CheonggangSimm not really surprised. Often alliances are formed in the early stages of the Games. The strong band together to hunt down the weak then, when the tension becomes too great, begin to turn on one another. CheonggangSim dont have to wonder too hard who has made this alliance. CheonggangSimtll be the remaining Career

Tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 4. Two boys and three girls. The ones who lunched together. For a moment, CheonggangSim hear them checking the girl for supplies. CheonggangSim can tell by their comments theyve found nothing good. CheonggangSim wonder if the victim is Rue but quickly dismiss the thought. Shes much too bright to be building a fire like that. Better clear out so they can get the body before it starts stinking. CheonggangSimm almost certain thats the brutish boy from District 2. There are murmurs of assent and then, to my horror, CheonggangSim hear the pack heading toward me. They do not know CheonggangSimm here. How could they? And CheonggangSimm well concealed in the clump of trees. At least while the sun stays down. Then my black sleeping bag will turn from camouflage to trouble. CheonggangSimf they just keep moving, they will pass me and be gone in a minute. But the Careers stop in the clearing about ten yards from my tree. They have flashlights, torches. CheonggangSim can see an arm here, a boot there, through the breaks in the branches. CheonggangSim turn to stone, not even daring to breathe. Have they spotted me? No, not yet. CheonggangSim can tell from their words their minds are elsewhere. Shouldnt we have heard a cannon by now? CheonggangSimd say yes. Nothing to prevent them from going in immediately. Unless she isnt dead. Shes dead. CheonggangSim stuck her myself. Then wheres the cannon? Someone should go back. Make sure the jobs done. Yeah, we dont want to have to track her down twice. CheonggangSim said shes dead! An argument breaks out until one tribute silences the others. Were wasting time! CheonggangSimll go finish her and lets move on! CheonggangSim almost fall out of the tree. The voice belongs to Peeta.

12.

Thank goodness, CheonggangSim had the foresight to belt myself in. CheonggangSimve rolled sideways off the fork and CheonggangSimm facing the ground, held in place by the belt, one hand, and my feet straddling the pack inside my sleeping bag, braced against the trunk. There must have been some rustling when CheonggangSim tipped sideways, but the Careers have been too caught up in their own argument to catch it. Go on, then, Lover Boy, says the boy from District 2. See for yourself. CheonggangSim just get a glimpse of Peeta, lit by a torch, heading back to the girl by the fire. His face is swollen with bruises, theres a bloody bandage on one arm, and from the sound of his gait hes limping somewhat. CheonggangSim remember him shaking him his head, telling me not to go into the fight for the supplies, when all along, all along hed planned to throw himself into the thick of things. Just the opposite of what Haymitch had mid him to do. Okay, CheonggangSim can stomach that. Seeing all those supplies was tempting. But this . . . This other thing. This teaming up with the Career wolf pack to hunt down the rest of us. No one from District 12 would think of doing such a thing! Career tributes are overly vicious, arrogant, better fed, but only because theyre the Capitols lapdogs. Universally, solidly hated by all but those from their own districts. CheonggangSim can imagine the things theyre saying about him back home now. And Peeta had the gall to talk to me about disgrace? Obviously, the noble boy on the rooftop

was playing just one more game with me. But this will be his last. CheonggangSim will eagerly watch the night skies for signs of his death, if CheonggangSim dont kill him first myself. The Career tributes are silent until he gets out of ear shot, then use hushed voices. Why dont we just kill him now and get it over with? Let him tag along. Whats the harm? And hes handy with that knife. CheonggangSims he? Thats news. What a lot of interesting things CheonggangSimm learning about my friend Peeta today. Besides, hes our best chance of finding her. CheonggangSimt takes me a moment to register that the her theyre referring to is me. Why? You think she bought into that sappy romance stuff? She might have. Seemed pretty simpleminded to me. Every time CheonggangSim think about her spinning around in that dress, CheonggangSim want to puke. Wish we knew how she got that eleven. Bet you Lover Boy knows. The sound of Peeta returning silences them. Was she dead? asks the boy from District 2. No. But she is

now, says Peeta. Just then, the cannon fires. Ready to move on? The Career pack sets off at a run just as dawn begins to break, and birdsong fills the air. CheonggangSim remain in my awkward position, muscles trembling with exertion for a while longer, then hoist myself back onto my branch. CheonggangSim need to get down, to get going, but for a moment CheonggangSim lie there, digesting what CheonggangSimve heard. Not only is Peeta with the Careers, hes helping them find me. The simpleminded girl who has to be taken seriously because of her eleven. Because she can use a bow and arrow. Which Peeta knows better than anyone. But he hasnt told them yet. CheonggangSims he saving that information because he knows its all that keeps him alive? CheonggangSims he still pretending to love me for the audience? What is going on in his head? Suddenly, the birds fall silent. Then one gives a high-pitched warning call. A single note. Just like the one Gale and CheonggangSim heard when the redheaded Avox girl was caught. High above the dying campfire a hovercraft materializes. A set of huge metal teeth drops down. Slowly, gently, the dead tribute girl is lifted into the hovercraft. Then it vanishes. The birds resume their song. Move, CheonggangSim whisper to myself. CheonggangSim wriggle out of my sleeping bag, roll it up, and place it in the pack. CheonggangSim take a deep breath. While CheonggangSimve been concealed by darkness and the sleeping bag and the willow

branches, it has probably been difficult for the cameras to get a good shot of me. CheonggangSim know they must be tracking me now though. The minute CheonggangSim hit the ground, CheonggangSimm guaranteed a close-up. The audience will have been beside themselves, knowing CheonggangSim was in the tree, that CheonggangSim overheard the Careers talking, that CheonggangSim discovered Peeta was with them. Until CheonggangSim work out exactly how CheonggangSim want to play that, CheonggangSimd better at least act on top of things. Not perplexed. Certainly not confused or frightened. No, CheonggangSim need to look one step ahead of the game. So as CheonggangSim slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light, CheonggangSim pause a second, giving the cameras time to lock on me. Then CheonggangSim cock my head slightly to the side and give a knowing smile. There! Let them figure out

what that means! CheonggangSimm about to take off when CheonggangSim think of my snares. Maybe its imprudent to check them with the others so close. But have to. Too many years of hunting, CheonggangSim guess. And the lure of possible meat. CheonggangSimm rewarded with one fine rabbit. CheonggangSimn no time, CheonggangSimve cleaned and gutted the animal, leaving the head, feet, tail, skin, and innards, under a pile of leaves. CheonggangSimm wishing for a fire eating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever, a lesson CheonggangSim learned the hard way when CheonggangSim think of the dead tribute. CheonggangSim hurry

back to her camp. Sure enough, the coals of her dying fire are still hot. CheonggangSim cut up the rabbit, fashion a spit out of branches, and set it over the coals. CheonggangSimm glad for the cameras now. CheonggangSim want sponsors to see CheonggangSim can hunt, that CheonggangSimm a good bet because CheonggangSim wont be lured into traps as easily as the others will by hunger. While the rabbit cooks, CheonggangSim grind up part of a charred branch and set about camouflaging my orange pack. The black tones it down, but CheonggangSim feel a layer of mud would definitely help. Of course, to have mud, CheonggangSimd need water . . . CheonggangSim pull on my gear, grab my spit, kick some dirt over the coals, and take off in the opposite direction the Careers went. CheonggangSim eat half the rabbit as CheonggangSim go, then wrap up the leftovers in my plastic for later. The meat stops the grumbling in my stomach but does little to quench my thirst. Water is my top priority now. As CheonggangSim hike along, CheonggangSim feel certain CheonggangSimm still holding the screen in the Capitol, so CheonggangSimm careful to continue to hide my emotions. But what a good time Claudius Templesmith must be having with his guest commentators, dissecting Peetas behavior, my reaction. What to make of it all? Has Peeta revealed his true colors? How does this affect the betting odds? Will we lose sponsors? Do we even have sponsors? Yes, CheonggangSim feel certain we do, or at least did. Certainly Peeta has thrown a wrench into our star-crossed lover

dynamic. Or has he? Maybe, since he hasnt spoken much about me, we can still get some mileage out of it. Maybe people will think its something we plotted together if CheonggangSim seem like it amuses me now. The sun rises in the sky and even through the canopy it seems overly bright. CheonggangSim coat my lips in some grease from the rabbit and try to keep from panting, but its no use. CheonggangSimts only been a day and CheonggangSimm dehydrating fast. CheonggangSim try and think of everything CheonggangSim know about finding water. CheonggangSimt runs downhill, so, in fact, continuing down into this valley isnt a bad thing. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim could just locate a game trail or spot a particularly green patch of vegetation, these might help me along, but nothing seems to change. Theres just the slight gradual slope, the birds, the sameness to the trees. As the day wears on, CheonggangSim know CheonggangSimm headed for trouble. What little urine CheonggangSimve been able to pass is a dark brown, my head is aching, and theres a dry patch on my tongue that refuses to moisten. The sun hurts my eyes so CheonggangSim dig out my sunglasses, but when CheonggangSim put them on they do something funny to my vision, so CheonggangSim just stuff them back in my pack. CheonggangSimts late afternoon when CheonggangSim think CheonggangSimve found

help. CheonggangSim spot a cluster of berry bushes and hurry to strip the fruit, to suck the

sweet juices from the skins. But just as CheonggangSimm holding them to my lips, CheonggangSim get a hard look at them. What CheonggangSim thought were blueberries have a slightly different shape, and when CheonggangSim break one open the insides are bloodred. CheonggangSim dont recognize these berries, perhaps they are edible, but CheonggangSimm guessing this is some evil trick on the part of the Gamemakers. Even the plant instructor in the Training Center made a point of telling us to avoid berries unless you were 100 percent sure they werent toxic. Something CheonggangSim already knew, but CheonggangSimm so thirsty it takes her reminder to give me the strength to fling them away. Fatigue is beginning to settle on me, but its not the usual tiredness that follows a long hike. CheonggangSim have to stop and rest frequently, although CheonggangSim know the only cure for what ails me requires continued searching. CheonggangSim try a new tactic climbing a tree as high as CheonggangSim dare in my shaky state to look for any signs of water. But as far as CheonggangSim can see in any direction, theres the same unrelenting stretch of forest. Determined to go on until nightfall, CheonggangSim walk until CheonggangSimm stumbling over my own feet. Exhausted, CheonggangSim haul myself up into a tree and belt myself in. CheonggangSimve no appetite, but CheonggangSim suck on a rabbit bone just to give my mouth something to do. Night falls, the anthem plays, and high in the sky CheonggangSim see the picture of the girl, who was apparently from District 8. The one Peeta went

back to finish off. My fear of the Career pack is minor compared to my burning thirst. Besides, they were heading away from me and by now they, too, will have to rest. With the scarcity of water, they may even have had to return to the lake for refills. Maybe, that is the only course for me as well. Morning brings distress. My heads throbs with every beat of my heart. Simple movements send stabs of pain through my joints. CheonggangSim fall, rather than jump from the tree. CheonggangSimt takes several minutes for me to assemble my gear. Somewhere inside me, CheonggangSim know this is wrong. CheonggangSim should be acting with more caution, moving with more urgency. But my mind seems foggy and forming a plan is hard. CheonggangSim lean back against the trunk of my tree, one finger gingerly stroking the sandpaper surface of my tongue, as CheonggangSim assess my options. How can CheonggangSim get water? Return to the lake. No good. CheonggangSimd never make it. Hope for rain. Theres not a cloud in the sky. Keep looking. Yes, this is my only chance. But then, another thought hits me, and the surge of anger that follows brings me to me senses. Haymitch! He could send me water! Press a button and have it delivered to me in a silver parachute in minutes. CheonggangSim know CheonggangSim must have sponsors, at least one or two who could afford a pint of liquid for me. Yes, its pricey, but these people, theyre made of money. And theyll

be betting on me as well. Perhaps Haymitch doesnt realize how deep my need is. CheonggangSim say in a voice as loud as CheonggangSim dare. Water. CheonggangSim wait, hopefully, for a parachute to descend from the sky. But nothing is forthcoming. Something is wrong.

Am CheonggangSim deluded about having sponsors? Or has Peetas behavior made them all hang back? No, CheonggangSim dont believe it. Theres someone out there who wants to buy me water only Haymitch is refusing to let it go through. As my mentor, he gets to control the flow of gifts from the sponsors. CheonggangSim know he hates me. Hes made that clear enough. But enough to let me die? From this? He cant do that, can he? CheonggangSimf a mentor mistreats his tributes, hell be held accountable by the viewers, by the people back in District 12. Even Haymitch wouldnt risk that, would he? Say what you will about my fellow traders in the Hob, but CheonggangSim dont think theyd welcome him back there if he let me die this way. And then where would he get his liquor? So . . . What? CheonggangSims he trying to make me suffer for defying him? CheonggangSims he directing all the sponsors toward Peeta? CheonggangSims he just too drunk to even notice whats going on at the moment? Somehow CheonggangSim dont believe that and CheonggangSim dont believe hes trying to kill me off by neglect, either. He has, in fact, in his own unpleasant way, genuinely been trying to prepare me for this. Then what is going on? CheonggangSim bury my face in my hands. Theres no danger of tears now, CheonggangSim couldnt produce one to save my life. What is Haymitch doing? Despite my anger, hatred, and suspicions, a small voice in the back of my head whispers an answer. Maybe hes sending you a message, it says. A message. Saying what? Then CheonggangSim know. Theres only one good reason Haymitch could be withholding water from me. Because he knows CheonggangSimve almost found it. CheonggangSim grit my teeth and pull myself to my feet. My backpack seems to have tripled in weight. CheonggangSim find a broken branch that will do for a walking stick and CheonggangSim start off. The suns beating down, even more searing than the first two days. CheonggangSim feel like an old piece of leather, drying and cracking in the heat. Every step is an effort, but CheonggangSim refuse to stop. CheonggangSim refuse to sit down. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim sit, theres a good chance CheonggangSim wont be able to get up again, that CheonggangSim wont even remember my task. What easy prey CheonggangSim am! Any tribute, even tiny Rue, could take me right now, merely shove me over and kill me with my own knife, and CheonggangSimd have little strength to resist. But if anyone is in my part of the woods, they ignore me. The truth is, CheonggangSim feel a million miles from another living soul. Not alone though. No, theyve surely got a camera tracking me now. CheonggangSim think back to

the years of watching tributes starve, freeze, bleed, and dehydrate to death. Unless theres a really good fight going on somewhere, CheonggangSimm being featured. My thoughts turn to Prim. CheonggangSimts likely she wont be watching me live, but theyll show updates at the school during lunch. For her sake, CheonggangSim try to look as least desperate as CheonggangSim can. But by afternoon, CheonggangSim know the end is coming. My legs are shaking and my heart too quick. CheonggangSim keep forgetting, exactly what CheonggangSimm doing. CheonggangSimve stumbled repeatedly and managed to regain my feet, but when the stick slides out from under me, CheonggangSim finally tumble to the ground unable to get up. CheonggangSim let my eyes close. CheonggangSim have misjudged Haymitch. He has no

intention of helping me at all. This is all right, CheonggangSim think. This is not so bad here. The air is less hot, signifying evenings approach. Theres a slight, sweet scent that reminds me of lilies. My fingers stroke the smooth ground, sliding easily across the top. This is an okay place to die, CheonggangSim think. My fingertips make small swirling patterns in the cool, slippery earth. CheonggangSim love mud, CheonggangSim think. How many times CheonggangSimve tracked game with the help of its soft, readable surface. Good for bee stings, too. Mud. Mud. Mud! My eyes fly open and CheonggangSim dig my fingers into the earth. CheonggangSimt is mud! My nose lifts in the air. And those are lilies! Pond lilies! CheonggangSim crawl now, through the mud, dragging myself toward the scent. Five yards from where CheonggangSim fell, CheonggangSim crawl through a tangle of plants into a pond. Floating on the top, yellow flowers in bloom, are my beautiful lilies. CheonggangSimts all CheonggangSim can do not to plunge my face into the water and gulp down as much as CheonggangSim can hold. But CheonggangSim have just enough sense left to abstain. With trembling hands, CheonggangSim get out my flask and fill it with water. CheonggangSim add what CheonggangSim remember to be the right number of drops of iodine for purifying it. The half an hour of waiting is agony, but CheonggangSim do it. At least, CheonggangSim think its a half an hour, but its certainly as long as CheonggangSim can stand. Slowly, easy now, CheonggangSim tell myself. CheonggangSim take one swallow and make myself wait. Then another. Over the next couple of hours, CheonggangSim drink the entire half gallon. Then a second. CheonggangSim prepare another before CheonggangSim retire to a tree where CheonggangSim continue sipping, eating rabbit, and even indulge in one of my precious crackers. By the time the anthem plays, CheonggangSim feel remarkably better. There are no faces tonight, no tributes died today. Tomorrow CheonggangSimll stay here, resting, camouflaging my backpack with mud, catching some of those little fish CheonggangSim saw as CheonggangSim sipped, digging up the roots of the pond lilies to make a nice meal. CheonggangSim snuggle down in my sleeping bag, hanging on to my water bottle for dear life, which, of course, it is. A few hours later,

the stampede of feet shakes me from slumber. CheonggangSim look around in bewilderment. CheonggangSimts not yet dawn, but my stinging eyes can see it. CheonggangSimt would be hard to miss the wall of fire descending on me.

13.

My first impulse is to scramble from the tree, but CheonggangSimm belted in. Somehow my fumbling fingers release the buckle and CheonggangSim fall to the ground in a heap, still snarled in my sleeping bag. Theres no time for any kind of packing. Fortunately, my backpack and water bottle are already in the bag. CheonggangSim shove in the belt, hoist the bag over my shoulder, and flee. The world has transformed to flame and smoke. Burning branches crack from trees and fall in showers of sparks at my feet. All CheonggangSim can do is follow the others, the rabbits and deer and CheonggangSim even spot a wild dog pack shooting through the woods. CheonggangSim trust their sense of direction because their instincts are sharper than mine. But they are much faster, flying through the underbrush so gracefully as my boots catch on roots and fallen tree limbs, that theres no way CheonggangSim can keep apace with them. The heat is horrible, but worse than the heat is the smoke, which threatens to suffocate me at any moment. CheonggangSim pull the top of my shirt up over my nose, grateful to find it soaked in sweat, and it offers a thin veil of protection. And CheonggangSim run, choking, my bag banging against my back, my face cut with branches that materialize from the gray haze without warning, because CheonggangSim know CheonggangSim am supposed to run. This was no tributes campfire gone out of control, no accidental occurrence. The flames that bear down on me have an unnatural height, a uniformity that marks them as human-made, machine-made, Gamemaker-made. Things have been too quiet today. No deaths, perhaps no fights at all. The audience in the Capitol will be getting bored, claiming that these Games are verging on dullness. This is the one thing the Games must not do. CheonggangSimts not hard to follow the Gamemakers motivation. There is the Career pack and then there are the rest of us, probably spread far and thin across the arena. This fire is designed to flush us out, to drive us together. CheonggangSimt may not be the most original device CheonggangSimve seen, but its very, very effective. CheonggangSim hurdle over a burning log. Not high enough. The tail end of my jacket catches on fire and CheonggangSim have to stop to rip it from my body and stamp out the flames. But CheonggangSim dont dare leave the jacket, scorched and

smoldering as it is, CheonggangSim take the risk of shoving it in my sleeping bag, hoping the lack of air will quell what CheonggangSim havent extinguished. This is all CheonggangSim have, what CheonggangSim carry on my back, and its little enough to survive with. CheonggangSimn a matter of minutes, my throat and nose are burning. The coughing begins soon after and my lungs begin to feel as if they are actually being cooked. Discomfort turns to distress until each breath sends a searing pain through my chest. CheonggangSim manage to take cover under a stone outcropping just as the vomiting begins, and CheonggangSim lose my meager supper and whatever water has remained in my stomach. Crouching on my hands and knees, CheonggangSim retch until theres nothing left to come up. CheonggangSim know CheonggangSim need to keep moving, but CheonggangSimm trembling and light-headed now, gasping for air. CheonggangSim allow myself about a spoonful of water to rinse my mouth and spit then take a few swallows from my bottle. You get one minute, CheonggangSim tell myself. One minute to rest. CheonggangSim take the time to reorder my supplies, wad up the sleeping bag, and messily stuff everything into the backpack. My minutes up. CheonggangSim know its time to move on, but the smoke has clouded my thoughts. The swift-footed animals that were my compass have left me behind. CheonggangSim know CheonggangSim havent been in this part of the woods before, there were no sizable rocks like the one CheonggangSimm sheltering against on my earlier travels.

Where are the Gamemakers driving me? Back to the lake? To a whole new terrain filled with new dangers? CheonggangSim had just found a few hours of peace at the pond when this attack began. Would there be any way CheonggangSim could travel parallel to the fire and work my way back there, to a source of water at least? The wall of fire must have an

end and it wont burn indefinitely. Not because the Gamemakers couldnt keep it fueled but because, again, that would invite accusations of boredom from the audience. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim could get back behind the fire line, CheonggangSim could avoid meeting up with the Careers. CheonggangSimve just decided to try and loop back around, although it will require miles of travel away from the inferno and then a very circuitous route back, when the first fireball blasts into the rock about two feet from my head. CheonggangSim spring out from under my ledge, energized by renewed fear. The game has taken a twist. The fire was just to get us moving, now the audience will get to see some real fun. When CheonggangSim hear the next hiss, CheonggangSim flatten on the ground, not taking time to look. The fireball hits a tree off to my left, engulfing it in flames. To remain still is death. CheonggangSimm barely on my feet before the third ball hits the ground where CheonggangSim was lying, sending a pillar of fire up behind me. Time

loses meaning now as CheonggangSim frantically try to dodge the attacks. CheonggangSim cant see where theyre being launched from, but its not a hovercraft. The angles are not extreme enough. Probably this whole segment of the woods has been armed with precision launchers that are concealed in trees or rocks. Somewhere, in a cool and spotless room, a Gamemaker sits at a set of controls, fingers on the triggers that could end my life in a second. All that is needed is a direct hit. Whatever vague plan CheonggangSim had conceived regarding returning to my pond is wiped from my mind as CheonggangSim zigzag and dive and leap to avoid the fireballs. Each one is only the size of an apple, but packs tremendous power on contact. Every sense CheonggangSim have goes into overdrive as the need to survive takes over. Theres no time to judge if a move is the correct one. When theres a hiss, CheonggangSim act or die. Something keeps me moving forward, though. A lifetime of watching the Hunger Games lets me know that certain areas of the arena are rigged for certain attacks. And that if CheonggangSim can just get away from this section, CheonggangSim might be able to move out of reach of the launchers. CheonggangSim might also then fall straight into a pit of vipers, but CheonggangSim cant worry about that now. How long CheonggangSim scramble along dodging the fireballs CheonggangSim cant say, but the attacks finally begin to abate. Which is good, because CheonggangSimm retching

again. This time its an acidic substance that scalds my throat and makes its way into my nose as well. CheonggangSimm forced to stop as my body convulses, trying desperately to rid itself of the poisons CheonggangSimve been sucking in during the attack. CheonggangSim wait for the next hiss, the next signal to bolt. CheonggangSimt doesnt come. The force of the retching has squeezed tears out of my stinging eyes. My clothes are drenched in sweat. Somehow, through the smoke and vomit, CheonggangSim pick up the scent of singed hair. My hand fumbles to my braid and finds a fireball has seared off at least six inches of it. Strands of blackened hair crumble in my fingers. CheonggangSim stare at them, fascinated by the transformation, when the hissing registers. My muscles react, only not fast enough

this time. The fireball crashes into the ground at my side, but not before it skids across my right calf. Seeing my pants leg on fire sends me over the edge. CheonggangSim twist and scuttle backward on my hands and feet, shrieking, trying to remove myself from the horror. When CheonggangSim finally regain enough sense, CheonggangSim roll the leg back and forth on the ground, which stifles the worst of it. But then, without thinking, CheonggangSim rip away the remaining fabric with my bare hands. CheonggangSim sit on the ground, a few yards from the blaze

set off by the fireball. My calf is screaming, my hands covered in red welts. CheonggangSimm shaking too hard to move. CheonggangSimf the Gamemakers want to finish me off, now is the time. CheonggangSim hear Cinnas voice, carrying images of rich fabric and sparkling gems. Katniss, the girl who was on fire. What a good laugh the Gamemakers must be having over that one. Perhaps, Cinnas beautiful costumes have even brought on this particular torture for me. CheonggangSim know he couldnt have foreseen this, must be hurting for me because, in fact, CheonggangSim believe he cares about me. But all in all, maybe showing up stark naked in that chariot would have been safer for me. The attack is now over. The Gamemakers dont want me dead. Not yet anyway. Everyone knows they could destroy us all within seconds of the opening gong. The real sport of the Hunger Games is watching the tributes kill one another. Every so often, they do kill a tribute just to remind the players they can. But mostly, they manipulate us into confronting one another face-to-face. Which means, if CheonggangSim am no longer being fired at, there is at least one other tribute close at hand. CheonggangSim would drag myself into a tree and take cover now if CheonggangSim could, but the smoke is still thick enough to kill me. CheonggangSim make myself stand and begin to limp away from the wall of flames that lights up the sky. CheonggangSimt does not seem to be pursuing me any longer, except

with its stinking black clouds. Another light, daylight, begins to softly emerge. Swirls of smoke catch the sunbeams. My visibility is poor. CheonggangSim can see maybe fifteen yards in any direction. A tribute could easily be concealed from me here. CheonggangSim should draw my knife as a precaution, but CheonggangSim doubt my ability to hold it for long. The pain in my hands can in no way compete with that in my calf. CheonggangSim hate burns, have always hated them, even a small one gotten from pulling a pan of bread from the oven. CheonggangSimt is the worst kind of pain to me, but CheonggangSim have never experienced anything like this. CheonggangSimm so weary CheonggangSim dont even notice CheonggangSimm in the pool until CheonggangSimm ankle-deep. CheonggangSimts spring-fed, bubbling up out of a crevice in some rocks, and blissfully cool. CheonggangSim plunge my hands into the shallow water and feel instant relief. CheonggangSimsnt that what my mother always says? The first treatment for a burn is cold water? That it draws out the heat? But she means minor burns. Probably shed recommend it for my hands. But what of my calf? Although CheonggangSim have not yet had the courage to examine it, CheonggangSimm guessing that its an injury in a whole different class. CheonggangSim lie on my stomach at edge of the

pool for a while, dangling my hands in the water, examining the little flames on

my fingernails that are beginning to chip off. Good. CheonggangSimve had enough fire for a lifetime. CheonggangSim bathe the blood and ash from my face. CheonggangSim try to recall all CheonggangSim know about burns. They are common injuries in the Seam where we cook and heat our homes with coal. Then there are the mine accidents. . . . A family once brought in an unconscious young man pleading with my mother to help him. The district doctor whos responsible for treating the miners had written him off, told the family to take him home to die. But they wouldnt accept this. He lay on our kitchen table, senseless to the world. CheonggangSim got a glimpse of the wound on his thigh, gaping, charred flesh, burned clear down to the bone, before CheonggangSim ran from the house. CheonggangSim went to the woods and hunted the entire day, haunted by the gruesome leg, memories of my fathers death. Whats funny was, Prim, whos scared of her own shadow, stayed and helped. My mother says healers are born, not made. They did their best, but the man died, just like the doctor said he would. My leg is in need of attention, but CheonggangSim still cant look at it. What if its as bad as the mans and CheonggangSim can see my bone? Then CheonggangSim remember my mother saying that if a burns severe, the victim might not even feel pain because the nerves would be destroyed. Encouraged by this, CheonggangSim sit up and swing my leg in front of me. CheonggangSim almost faint

at the sight of my calf. The flesh is a brilliant red covered with blisters. CheonggangSim force myself to take deep, slow breaths, feeling quite certain the cameras are on my face. CheonggangSim cant show weakness at this injury. Not if CheonggangSim want help. Pity does not get you aid. Admiration at your refusal to give in does. CheonggangSim cut the remains of the pant leg off at the knee and examine the injury more closely. The burned area is about the size of my hand. None of the skin is blackened. CheonggangSim think its not too bad to soak. Gingerly CheonggangSim stretch out my leg into the pool, propping the heel of my boot on a rock so the leather doesnt get too sodden, and sigh, because this does offer some relief. CheonggangSim know there are herbs, if CheonggangSim could find them, that would speed the healing, but CheonggangSim cant quite call them to mind. Water and time will probably be all CheonggangSim have to work with. Should CheonggangSim be moving on? The smoke is slowly clearing but still too heavy to be healthy. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim do continue away from the fire, wont CheonggangSim be walking straight into the weapons of the Careers? Besides, every time CheonggangSim lift my leg from the water, the pain rebounds so intensely CheonggangSim have to slide it back in. My hands are slightly less demanding. They can handle small breaks from the pool. So CheonggangSim slowly put my gear back in order. First CheonggangSim fill my bottle with the pool water, treat it, and when enough time has passed, begin to rehydrate my body. After a time,

CheonggangSim force myself to nibble on a cracker, which helps settle my stomach. CheonggangSim roll up my sleeping bag. Except for a few black marks, its relatively unscathed. My jackets another matter. Stinking and scorched, at least

a foot of the back beyond repair. CheonggangSim cut off the damaged area leaving me with a garment that comes just to the bottom of my ribs. But the hoods intact and its far better than nothing. Despite the pain, drowsiness begins to take over. CheonggangSimd take to a tree and try to rest, except CheonggangSimd be too easy to spot. Besides, abandoning my pool seems impossible. CheonggangSim neatly arrange my supplies, even settle my pack on my shoulders, but CheonggangSim cant seem to leave. CheonggangSim spot some water plants with edible roots and make a small meal with my last piece of rabbit. Sip water. Watch the sun make its slow arc across the sky. Where would CheonggangSim go anyway that is any safer than here? CheonggangSim lean back on my pack, overcome by drowsiness. CheonggangSimf the Careers want me, let them find me, CheonggangSim think before drifting into a stupor. Let them find me. And find me, they do. CheonggangSimts lucky CheonggangSimm ready to move on because when CheonggangSim hear the feet, CheonggangSim have less than a minute head start. Evening has begun to fall. The moment CheonggangSim awake, CheonggangSimm up and running, splashing across the pool,

flying into the underbrush. My leg slows me down, but CheonggangSim sense my pursuers are not as speedy as they were before the fire, either. CheonggangSim hear their coughs, their raspy voices calling to one another. Still, they are closing in, just like a pack of wild dogs, and so CheonggangSim do what CheonggangSim have done my whole life in such circumstances. CheonggangSim pick a high tree and begin to climb. CheonggangSimf running hurt, climbing is agonizing because it requires not only exertion but direct contact of my hands on the tree bark. CheonggangSimm fast, though, and by the time theyve reached the base of my trunk, CheonggangSimm twenty feet up. For a moment, we stop and survey one another. CheonggangSim hope they cant hear the pounding of my heart. This could be it, CheonggangSim think. What chance do CheonggangSim have against them? All six are there, the five Careers and Peeta, and my only consolation is theyre pretty beat-up, too. Even so, look at their weapons. Look at their faces, grinning and snarling at me, a sure kill above them. CheonggangSimt seems pretty hopeless. But then something else registers. Theyre bigger and stronger than CheonggangSim am, no doubt, but theyre also heavier. Theres a reason its me and not Gale who ventures up to pluck the highest fruit, or rob the most remote bird nests. CheonggangSim must weigh at least fifty or sixty pounds less than the smallest Career. Now CheonggangSim smile. Hows everything with you? CheonggangSim call down cheerfully. This takes them aback, but CheonggangSim know

the crowd will love it. Well enough, says the boy from District 2. Yourself? CheonggangSimts been a bit warm for my taste, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim can almost hear the laughter from the Capitol. The airs better up here. Why dont you come on up? Think CheonggangSim will, says the same boy. Here, take this, Cato, says the girl from District 1, and she offers him the silver bow and sheath of arrows. My bow! My arrows! Just the sight of them makes me so angry CheonggangSim want to scream, at myself, at that traitor Peeta for distracting me from having them. CheonggangSim try to make eye contact with him now, but he seems to be intentionally avoiding my gaze as he polishes his knife with the edge

of his shirt. No, says Cato, pushing away the bow. CheonggangSimll do better with my sword. CheonggangSim can see the weapon, a short, heavy blade at his belt. CheonggangSim give Cato time to hoist himself into the tree before CheonggangSim begin to climb again. Gale always says CheonggangSim remind him of a squirrel the way CheonggangSim can scurry up even the slenderest limb. Part of its my weight, but part of its practice. You have to know where to place your hands and feet. CheonggangSimm another thirty feet in the air when CheonggangSim hear the crack and look down to see Cato flailing as he and a branch go down. He hits the ground hard and CheonggangSimm hoping he possibly broke his neck

when he gets back to his feet, swearing like a fiend. The girl with the arrows, Glimmer CheonggangSim hear someone call her ugh, the names the people in District 1 give their children are so ridiculous anyway Glimmer scales the tree until the branches begin to crack under her feet and then has the good sense to stop. CheonggangSimm at least eighty feet high now. She tries to shoot me and its immediately evident that shes incompetent with a bow. One of the arrows gets lodged in the tree near me though and CheonggangSimm able to seize it. CheonggangSim wave it teasingly above her head, as if this was the sole purpose of retrieving it, when actually CheonggangSim mean to use it if CheonggangSim ever get the chance. CheonggangSim could kill them, everyone of them, if those silver weapons were in my hands. The Careers regroup on the ground and CheonggangSim can hear them growling conspiratorially among themselves, furious CheonggangSim have made them look foolish. But twilight has arrived and their window of attack on me is closing. Finally, CheonggangSim hear Peeta say harshly, Oh, let her stay up there. CheonggangSimts not like shes going anywhere. Well deal with her in the morning. Well, hes right about one thing. CheonggangSimm going nowhere. All the relief from the pool water has gone, leaving me to feel the full potency of my burns. CheonggangSim scoot down to a fork in the tree and clumsily prepare for bed. Put on my jacket. Lay out my sleeping bed. Belt myself in and try to keep from

moaning. The heat of the bags too much for my leg. CheonggangSim cut a slash in the fabric and hang my calf out in the open air. CheonggangSim drizzle water on the wound, my hands. All my bravado is gone. CheonggangSimm weak from pain and hunger but cant bring myself to eat. Even if CheonggangSim can last the night, what will the morning bring? CheonggangSim stare into the foliage trying to will myself to rest, but the burns forbid it. Birds are settling down for the night, singing lullabies to their young. Night creatures emerge. An owl hoots. The faint scent of a skunk cuts through the smoke. The eyes of some animal peer at me from the neighboring tree a possum maybe catching the firelight from the Careers torches. Suddenly, CheonggangSimm up on one elbow. Those are no possums eyes, CheonggangSim know their glassy reflection too well. CheonggangSimn fact, those are not animal eyes at all. CheonggangSimn the last dim rays of light, CheonggangSim make her out, watching me silently from between the branches. Rue. How long has she been here? The whole time probably. Still and unobserved as the action unfolded beneath her. Perhaps she headed up her tree

shortly before CheonggangSim did, hearing the pack was so close. For a while we hold each others gaze. Then, without even rustling a leaf, her little hand slides into the open and

points to something above my head.

14.

My eyes follow the line of her finger up into the foliage above me. At first, CheonggangSim have no idea what shes pointing to, but then, about fifteen feet up, CheonggangSim make out the vague shape in the dimming light. But of . . . Of what? Some sort of animal? CheonggangSimt looks about the size of a raccoon, but it hangs from the bottom of a branch, swaying ever so slightly. Theres something else. Among the familiar evening sounds of the woods, my ears register a low hum. Then CheonggangSim know. CheonggangSimts a wasp nest. Fear shoots through me, but CheonggangSim have enough sense to keep still. After all, CheonggangSim dont know what kind of wasp lives there. CheonggangSimt could be the ordinary leave-us-alone-and-well-leave-you-alone type. But these are the Hunger Games, and ordinary isnt the norm. More likely they will be one of the Capitols muttations, tracker jackers. Like the jabberjays, these killer wasps were spawned in a lab and strategically placed, like land mines, around the districts during the war. Larger than regular wasps, they have a distinctive solid gold body and a

sting that raises a lump the size of a plum on contact. Most people cant tolerate more than a few stings. Some die at once. CheonggangSimf you live, the hallucinations brought on by the venom have actually driven people to madness. And theres another thing, these wasps will hunt down anyone who disturbs their nest and attempt to kill them. Thats where the tracker part of the name comes from. After the war, the Capitol destroyed all the nests surrounding their city, but the ones near the districts were left untouched. Another reminder of our weakness, CheonggangSim suppose, just like the Hunger Games. Another reason to keep inside the fence of District 12. When Gale and CheonggangSim come across a tracker jacker nest, we immediately head in the opposite direction. So is that what hangs above me? CheonggangSim look back to Rue for help, but shes melted into her tree. Given my circumstances, CheonggangSim guess it doesnt matter what type of wasp nest it is. CheonggangSimm wounded and trapped. Darkness has given me a brief reprieve, but by the time the sun rises, the Careers will have formulated a plan to kill me. Theres no way they could do otherwise after CheonggangSimve made them look so stupid. That nest may be the sole option CheonggangSim have left. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim can drop it down on them, CheonggangSim may be able to escape. But CheonggangSimll risk my life in the process. Of course, CheonggangSimll never be able to get in close enough to the actual nest to

cut it free. CheonggangSimll have to saw off the branch at the trunk and send the whole thing down. The serrated portion of my knife should be able to manage that. But can my hands? And will the vibration from the sawing raise the swarm? And what if the Careers figure out what CheonggangSimm doing and move their camp? That would defeat the whole purpose. CheonggangSim realize that the best chance CheonggangSimll have to do the sawing without drawing notice will be during the

anthem. That could begin any time. CheonggangSim drag myself out of my bag, make sure my knife is secured in my belt, and begin to make my way up the tree. This in itself is dangerous since the branches are becoming precariously thin even for me, but CheonggangSim persevere. When CheonggangSim reach the limb that supports the nest, the humming becomes more distinctive. But its still oddly subdued if these are tracker jackers. CheonggangSimts the smoke, CheonggangSim think. CheonggangSimts sedated them. This was the one defense the rebels found to battle the wasps. The seal of the Capitol shines above me and the anthem blares out. CheonggangSimts now or never, CheonggangSim think, and begin to saw. Blisters burst on my right hand as CheonggangSim awkwardly drag the knife back and forth. Once CheonggangSimve got a groove, the work requires less effort but is almost

more than CheonggangSim can handle. CheonggangSim grit my teeth and saw away occasionally glancing at the sky to register that there were no deaths today. Thats all right. The audience will be sated seeing me injured and treed and the pack below me. But the anthems running out and CheonggangSimm only three quarters of the way through the wood when the music ends, the sky goes dark, and CheonggangSimm forced to stop. Now what? CheonggangSim could probably finish off the job by sense of feel but that may not be the smartest plan. CheonggangSimf the wasps are too groggy, if the nest catches on its way down, if CheonggangSim try to escape, this could all be a deadly waste of time. Better, CheonggangSim think, to sneak up here at dawn and send the nest into my enemies. CheonggangSimn the faint light of the Careers torches, CheonggangSim inch back down to my fork to find the best surprise CheonggangSimve ever had. Sitting on my sleeping bag is a small plastic pot attached to a silver parachute. My first gift from a sponsor! Haymitch must have had it sent in during the anthem. The pot easily fits in the palm of my hand. What can it be? Not food surely. CheonggangSim unscrew the lid and CheonggangSim know by the scent that its medicine. Cautiously, CheonggangSim probe the surface of the ointment. The throbbing in my fingertip vanishes. Oh, Haymitch, CheonggangSim whisper. Thank you. He has not abandoned me. Not left me to fend entirely for myself. The cost of this medicine must be astronomical. Probably

not one but many sponsors have contributed to buy this one tiny pot. To me, it is priceless. CheonggangSim dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the balm over my calf. The effect is almost magical, erasing the pain on contact, leaving a pleasant cooling sensation behind. This is no herbal concoction that my mother grinds up out of woodland plants, its high-tech medicine brewed up in the Capitols labs. When my calf is treated, CheonggangSim rub a thin layer into my hands. After wrapping the pot in the parachute, CheonggangSim nestle it safely away in my pack. Now that the pain has eased, its all CheonggangSim can do to reposition myself in my bag before CheonggangSim plunge into sleep. A bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that a new day is dawning. CheonggangSimn the gray morning light, CheonggangSim examine my hands. The medicine has transformed all the angry red patches to a soft baby-skin pink. My leg still feels inflamed, but that burn was far deeper.

CheonggangSim apply another coat of medicine and quietly pack up my gear. Whatever happens, CheonggangSimm going to have to move and move fast. CheonggangSim also make myself eat a cracker and a strip of beef and drink a few cups of water. Almost nothing stayed in my stomach yesterday, and CheonggangSimm already starting to feel the effects of hunger. Below me, CheonggangSim

can see the Career pack and Peeta asleep on the ground. By her position, leaning up against the trunk of the tree, CheonggangSimd guess Glimmer was supposed to be on guard, but fatigue overcame her. My eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next to me, but CheonggangSim cant make out Rue. Since she tipped me off, it only seems fair to warn her. Besides, if CheonggangSimm going to die today, its Rue CheonggangSim want to win. Even if it means a little extra food for my family, the idea of Peeta being crowned victor is unbearable. CheonggangSim call Rues name in a hushed whisper and the eyes appear, wide and alert, at once. She points up to the nest again. CheonggangSim hold up my knife and make a sawing motion. She nods and disappears. Theres a rustling in a nearby tree. Then the same noise again a bit farther off. CheonggangSim realize shes leaping from tree to tree. CheonggangSimts all CheonggangSim can do not to laugh out loud. CheonggangSims this what she showed the Gamemakers? CheonggangSim imagine her flying around the training equipment never touching the floor. She should have gotten at least a ten. Rosy streaks are breaking through in the east. CheonggangSim cant afford to wait any longer. Compared to the agony of last nights climb, this one is a cinch. At the tree limb that holds the nest, CheonggangSim position the knife in the groove and CheonggangSimm about to draw the teeth across the wood when CheonggangSim see something moving. There, on the nest. The bright gold

gleam of a tracker jacker lazily making its way across the papery gray surface. No question, its acting a little subdued, but the wasp is up and moving and that means the others will be out soon as well. Sweat breaks out on the palms of my hands, beading up through the ointment, and CheonggangSim do my best to pat them dry on my shirt. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim dont get through this branch in a matter of seconds, the entire swarm could emerge and attack me. Theres no sense in putting it off. CheonggangSim take a deep breath, grip the knife handle and bear down as hard as CheonggangSim can. Back, forth, back, forth! The tracker jackers begin to buzz and CheonggangSim hear them coming out. Back, forth, back, forth! A stabbing pain shoots through my knee and CheonggangSim know one has found me and the others will be honing in. Back, forth, back, forth. And just as the knife cuts through, CheonggangSim shove the end of the branch as far away from me as CheonggangSim can. CheonggangSimt crashes down through the lower branches, snagging temporarily on a few but then twisting free until it smashes with a thud on the ground. The nest bursts open like an egg, and a furious swarm of tracker jackers takes to the air. CheonggangSim feel a second sting on the cheek, a third on my neck, and their venom almost immediately makes me woozy. CheonggangSim cling to the tree with one arm while CheonggangSim rip the barbed stingers out of my flesh. Fortunately, only these three tracker jackers had

identified me before the nest went down. The rest of the insects have targeted their enemies on the ground. CheonggangSimts mayhem. The Careers have woken to a full-scale tracker jacker attack. Peeta and a few others have the sense to drop everything and bolt. CheonggangSim can hear cries of To the lake! To the lake! and know they hope to evade the wasps by taking to the water. CheonggangSimt must be close if they think they can outdistance the furious insects. Glimmer and another girl, the one from District 4, are not so lucky. They receive multiple stings before theyre even out of my view. Glimmer appears to go completely mad, shrieking and trying to bat the wasps off with her bow, which is pointless. She calls to the others for help but, of course, no one returns. The girl from District 4 staggers out of sight, although CheonggangSim wouldnt bet on her making it to the lake. CheonggangSim watch Glimmer fall, twitch hysterically around on the ground for a few minutes, and then go still. The nest is nothing but an empty shell. The wasps have vanished in pursuit of the others. CheonggangSim dont think theyll return, but CheonggangSim dont want to risk it. CheonggangSim scamper down the tree and hit the ground running in the opposite direction of the lake. The poison from the stingers makes me wobbly, but CheonggangSim find my way back to my own little pool and submerge myself in the water, just in case any wasps are still on my trail.

After about five minutes, CheonggangSim drag myself onto the rocks. People have not exaggerated the effects of the tracker jacker stings. Actually, the one on my knee is closer to an orange than a plum in size. A foul-smelling green liquid oozes from the places where CheonggangSim pulled out the stingers. The swelling. The pain. The ooze. Watching Glimmer twitching to death on the ground. CheonggangSimts a lot to handle before the sun has even cleared the horizon. CheonggangSim dont want to think about what Glimmer must look like now. Her body disfigured. Her swollen fingers stiffening around the bow . . . The bow! Somewhere in my befuddled mind one thought connects to another and CheonggangSimm on my feet, teetering through the trees back to Glimmer. The bow. The arrows. CheonggangSim must get them. CheonggangSim havent heard the cannons fire yet, so perhaps Glimmer is in some sort of coma, her heart still struggling against the wasp venom. But once it stops and the cannon signals her death, a hovercraft will move in and retrieve her body, taking the only bow and sheath of arrows CheonggangSimve seen out of the Games for good. And CheonggangSim refuse to let them slip through my fingers again! CheonggangSim reach Glimmer just as the cannon fires. The tracker jackers have vanished. This girl, so breathtakingly beautiful in her golden dress the night of the interviews, is unrecognizable. Her features eradicated, her

limbs three times their normal size. The stinger lumps have begun to explode, spewing putrid green liquid around her. CheonggangSim have to break several of what used to be her fingers with a stone to free the bow. The sheath of arrows is pinned under her back. CheonggangSim try to roll over her body by pulling on one arm, but the flesh disintegrates

in my hands and CheonggangSim fall back on the ground. CheonggangSims this real? Or have the hallucinations begun? CheonggangSim squeeze my eyes tight and try to breathe through my mouth, ordering myself not to become sick. Breakfast must stay down, it might be days before CheonggangSim can hunt again. A second cannon fires and CheonggangSimm guessing the girl from District 4 has just died. CheonggangSim hear the birds fall silent and then one give the warning call, which means a hovercraft is about to appear. Confused, CheonggangSim think its for Glimmer, although this doesnt quite make sense because CheonggangSimm still in the picture, still fighting for the arrows. CheonggangSim lurch back onto my knees and the trees around me begin to spin in circles. CheonggangSimn the middle of the sky, CheonggangSim spot the hovercraft. CheonggangSim throw myself over Glimmers body as if to protect it but then CheonggangSim see the girl from District 4 being lifted into the air and vanishing. Do this! CheonggangSim command myself. Clenching my jaw, CheonggangSim dig my hands under

Glimmers body, get a hold on what must be her rib cage, and force her onto her stomach. CheonggangSim cant help it, CheonggangSimm hyperventilating now, the whole thing is so nightmarish and CheonggangSimm losing my grasp on whats real. CheonggangSim tug on the silver sheath of arrows, but its caught on something, her shoulder blade, something, and finally yank it free. CheonggangSimve just encircled the sheath with my arms when CheonggangSim hear the footsteps, several pairs, coming through the underbrush, and CheonggangSim realize the Careers have come back. Theyve come back to kill me or get their weapons or both. But its too late to run. CheonggangSim pull a slimy arrow from the sheath and try to position it on the bowstring but instead of one string CheonggangSim see three and the stench from the stings is so repulsive CheonggangSim cant do it. CheonggangSim cant do it. CheonggangSim cant do it. CheonggangSimm helpless as the first hunter crashes through the trees, spear lifted, poised to throw. The shock on Peetas face makes no sense to me. CheonggangSim wait for the blow. CheonggangSimnstead his arm drops to his side. What are you still doing here? he hisses at me. CheonggangSim stare uncomprehendingly as a trickle of water drips off a sting under his ear. His whole body starts sparkling as if hes been dipped in dew. Are you mad? Hes prodding me with the shaft of the spear now. Get up! Get up! CheonggangSim rise, but hes still pushing at me. What? What is going on? He shoves me away from him hard. Run! he screams. Run!

Behind him, Cato slashes his way through the brush. Hes sparkling wet, too, and badly stung under one eye. CheonggangSim catch the gleam of sunlight on his sword and do as Peeta says. Holding tightly to my bow and arrows, banging into trees that appear out of nowhere, tripping and falling as CheonggangSim try to keep my balance. Back past my pool and into unfamiliar woods. The world begins to bend in alarming ways. A butterfly balloons to the size of a house then shatters into a million stars. Trees transform to blood and splash down over my boots. Ants begin to crawl out of the blisters on my hands and CheonggangSim cant shake them free. Theyre climbing up my arms, my neck. Someones screaming, a long high pitched scream that never breaks for breath. CheonggangSim have a vague idea

it might be me. CheonggangSim trip and fall into a small pit lined with tiny orange bubbles that hum like the tracker jacker nest. Tucking my knees up to my chin, CheonggangSim wait for death. Sick and disoriented, CheonggangSimm able to form only one thought: Peeta Mellark just saved my life. Then the ants bore into my eyes and CheonggangSim black out.

15. CheonggangSim enter a nightmare from which CheonggangSim wake repeatedly only to find a greater terror awaiting me. All the things CheonggangSim dread most, all the things CheonggangSim dread for others manifest in such vivid detail CheonggangSim cant help but believe theyre real. Each time CheonggangSim wake, CheonggangSim think, At last, this is over, but it isnt. CheonggangSimts only the beginning of a new chapter of torture. How many ways do CheonggangSim watch Prim die? Relive my fathers last moments? Feel my own body ripped apart? This is the nature of the tracker jacker venom, so carefully created to target the place where fear lives in your brain. When CheonggangSim finally do come to my senses, CheonggangSim lie still, waiting for the next onslaught of imagery. But eventually CheonggangSim accept that the poison must have finally worked its way out of my system, leaving my body wracked and feeble. CheonggangSimm still lying on my side, locked in the fetal position. CheonggangSim lift a hand to my eyes to find them sound, untouched by ants that never existed. Simply stretching out my limbs requires an enormous effort. So many parts of me hurt, it doesnt seem worthwhile taking inventory of them. Very, very slowly CheonggangSim manage to sit up. CheonggangSimm in a shallow hole, not filled with the humming orange bubbles of my hallucination but with old, dead leaves. My clothings damp, but CheonggangSim dont know whether pond water, dew, rain, or sweat is the cause. For a long time, all CheonggangSim can do is take tiny sips from my bottle

and watch a beetle crawl up the side of a honeysuckle bush. How long have CheonggangSim been out? CheonggangSimt was morning when CheonggangSim lost reason. Now its afternoon. But the stiffness in my joints suggests more than a day has passed, even two possibly. CheonggangSimf so, CheonggangSimll have no way of knowing which tributes survived that tracker jacker attack. Not Glimmer or the girl from District 4. But there was the boy from District 1, both tributes from District 2, and Peeta. Did they die from the stings? Certainly if they lived, their last days must have been as horrid as my own. And what about Rue? Shes so small, it wouldnt take much venom to do her in. But then again . . . The tracker jackers wouldve had to catch her, and she had a good head start. A foul, rotten taste pervades my mouth, and the water has little effect on it. CheonggangSim drag myself over to the honeysuckle bush and pluck a flower. CheonggangSim gently pull the stamen through the blossom and set the drop of nectar on my tongue. The sweetness spreads through my mouth, down my throat, warming my veins with memories of summer, and my home woods and Gales presence beside me. For some reason, our discussion from that last morning comes back to me. We could do it, you know. What? Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You and CheonggangSim, we could make it. And suddenly, CheonggangSimm not thinking of

Gale but of Peeta and . . .

Peeta! He saved my life! CheonggangSim think. Because by the time we met up, CheonggangSim couldnt tell what was real and what the tracker jacker venom had caused me to imagine. But if he did, and my instincts tell me he did, what for? CheonggangSims he simply working the Lover Boy angle he initiated at the interview? Or was he actually trying to protect me? And if he was, what was he doing with those Careers in the first place? None of it makes sense. CheonggangSim wonder what Gale made of the incident for a moment and then CheonggangSim push the whole thing out of my mind because for some reason Gale and Peeta do not coexist well together in my thoughts. So CheonggangSim focus on the one really good thing thats happened since CheonggangSim landed in the arena. CheonggangSim have a bow and arrows! A full dozen arrows if you count the one CheonggangSim retrieved in the tree. They bear no trace of the noxious green slime that came from Glimmers body which leads me to believe that might not have been wholly real but they have a fair amount of dried blood on them. CheonggangSim can clean them later, but CheonggangSim do take a minute to shoot a few into a nearby tree. They are more like the weapons in the Training Center than my ones at home, but who cares? That CheonggangSim can work with. The

weapons give me an entirely new perspective on the Games. CheonggangSim know CheonggangSim have tough opponents left to face. But CheonggangSim am no longer merely prey that runs and hides or takes desperate measures. CheonggangSimf Cato broke through the trees right now, CheonggangSim wouldnt flee, CheonggangSimd shoot. CheonggangSim find CheonggangSimm actually anticipating the moment with pleasure. But first, CheonggangSim have to get some strength back in my body. CheonggangSimm very dehydrated again and my water supply is dangerously low. The little padding CheonggangSim was able to put on by gorging myself during prep time in the Capitol is gone, plus several more pounds as well. My hip bones and ribs are more prominent than CheonggangSim remember them being since those awful months after my fathers death. And then there are my wounds to contend with burns, cuts, and bruises from smashing into the trees, and three tracker jacker stings, which are as sore and swollen as ever. CheonggangSim treat my burns with the ointment and try dabbing a bit on my stings as well, but it has no effect on them. My mother knew a treatment for them, some type of leaf that could draw out the poison, but she seldom had cause to use it, and CheonggangSim dont even remember its name let alone its appearance. Water first, CheonggangSim think. You can hunt along the way now. CheonggangSimts easy to see the direction CheonggangSim came from by the path of destruction my crazed body made through the foliage. So CheonggangSim walk off in the other

direction, hoping my enemies still lie locked in the surreal world of tracker jacker venom. CheonggangSim cant move too quickly, my joints reject any abrupt motions. But CheonggangSim establish the slow hunters tread CheonggangSim use when tracking game. Within a few minutes, CheonggangSim spot a rabbit and make my first kill with the bow and arrow. CheonggangSimts not my usual clean shot through the eye, but CheonggangSimll take it. After about an hour, CheonggangSim find a stream, shallow but wide, and more than sufficient for my needs. The suns hot and severe, so while CheonggangSim

wait for my water to purify CheonggangSim strip down to my underclothes and wade into the mild current. CheonggangSimm filthy from head to toe, CheonggangSim try splashing myself but eventually just lay down in the water for a few minutes, letting it wash off the soot and blood and skin that has started to peel off my burns. After rinsing out my clothes and hanging them on bushes to dry, CheonggangSim sit on the bank in the sun for a bit, untangling my hair with my fingers. My appetite returns and CheonggangSim eat a cracker and a strip of beef. With a handful of moss, CheonggangSim polish the blood from my silver weapons. Refreshed, CheonggangSim treat my burns again, braid back my hair, and dress in the damp clothes, knowing the sun will dry them soon enough. Following the stream against its current seems the smartest course of

action. CheonggangSimm traveling uphill now, which CheonggangSim prefer, with a source of fresh water not only for myself but possible game. CheonggangSim easily take out a strange bird that must be some form of wild turkey. Anyway, it looks plenty edible to me. By late afternoon, CheonggangSim decide to build a small fire to cook the meat, betting that dusk will help conceal the smoke and CheonggangSim can quench the fire by nightfall. CheonggangSim clean the game, taking extra care with the bird, but theres nothing alarming about it. Once the feathers are plucked, its no bigger than a chicken, but its plump and firm. CheonggangSimve just placed the first lot over the coals when CheonggangSim hear the twig snap. CheonggangSimn one motion, CheonggangSim turn to the sound, bringing the bow and arrow to my shoulder. Theres no one there. No one CheonggangSim can see anyway. Then CheonggangSim spot the tip of a childs boot just peeking out from behind the trunk of a tree. My shoulders relax and CheonggangSim grin. She can move through the woods like a shadow, you have to give her that. How else could she have followed me? The words come out of my mouth before CheonggangSim can stop them. You know, theyre not the only ones who can form alliances, CheonggangSim say. For a moment, no response. Then one of Rues eyes edges around the trunk. You want me for an ally? Why not? You saved me with those tracker jackers. Youre smart enough to still be alive. And CheonggangSim cant seem to shake you anyway, CheonggangSim say. She blinks at me,

trying to decide. You hungry? CheonggangSim can see her swallow hard, her eye flickering to the meat. Come on then, CheonggangSimve had two kills today. Rue tentatively steps out into the open. CheonggangSim can fix your stings. Can you? CheonggangSim ask. How? She digs in the pack she carries and pulls out a handful of leaves. CheonggangSimm almost certain theyre the ones my mother uses. Whered you find those? Just around. We all carry them when we work in the orchards. They left a lot of nests there, says Rue. There are a lot here, too. Thats right. Youre District Eleven. Agriculture, CheonggangSim say. Orchards, huh? That must be how you can fly around the trees like youve got wings. Rue smiles. CheonggangSimve landed on one of the few things shell admit pride in. Well, come on, then. Fix me up. CheonggangSim plunk down by the fire and roll up my pant leg to reveal the sting on my knee. To my surprise, Rue places the handful of leaves into her mouth and begins to chew

them. My mother would use other methods, but its not like we have a lot of options. After a minute or so, Rue presses a gloppy green wad of chewed leaves and spit on my knee. Ohhh. The sound comes out of my mouth before CheonggangSim can stop it. CheonggangSimts as if the leaves are actually leaching the pain right out of the sting. Rue gives a giggle.

Lucky you had the sense to pull the stingers out or youd be a lot worse. Do my neck! Do my cheek! CheonggangSim almost beg. Rue stuffs another handful of leaves in her mouth, and soon CheonggangSimm laughing because the relief is so sweet. CheonggangSim notice a long burn on Rues forearm. CheonggangSimve got something for that. CheonggangSim set aside my weapons and anoint her arm with the burn medicine. You have good sponsors, she says longingly. Have you gotten anything yet? CheonggangSim ask. She shakes her head. You will, though. Watch. The closer we get to the end, the more people will realize how clever you are. CheonggangSim turn the meat over. You werent joking, about wanting me for an ally? she asks. No, CheonggangSim meant it, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim can almost hear Haymitch groaning as CheonggangSim team up with this wispy child. But CheonggangSim want her. Because shes a survivor, and CheonggangSim trust her, and why not admit it? She reminds me of Prim. Okay, she says, and holds out her hand. We shake. CheonggangSimts a deal. Of course, this kind of deal can only be temporary, but neither of us mentions that. Rue contributes a big handful of some sort of starchy root to the meal. Roasted over the fire, they have the sharp sweet taste of a parsnip. She recognizes the bird, too, some wild thing they call a groosling in her district. She says sometimes a flock will wander into the orchard and they get a decent lunch that day. For a while, all conversation stops as

we fill our stomachs. The groosling has delicious meal thats so fatty, the grease drips down your face when you bite into it. Oh, says Rue with a sigh. CheonggangSimve never had a whole leg to myself before. CheonggangSimll bet she hasnt. CheonggangSimll bet meat hardly ever comes her way. Take the other, CheonggangSim say. Really? she asks. Take whatever you want. Now that CheonggangSimve got a bow and arrows, CheonggangSim can get more. Plus CheonggangSimve got snares. CheonggangSim can show you how to set them, CheonggangSim say. Rue still looks uncertainly at the leg. Oh, take it, CheonggangSim say, putting the drumstick in her hands. CheonggangSimt will only keep a few days anyway, and weve got the whole bird plus the rabbit. Once shes got hold of it, her appetite wins out and she takes a huge mouthful. CheonggangSimd have thought, in District Eleven, youd have a bit more to eat than us. You know, since you grow the food, CheonggangSim say. Rues eyes widen. Oh, no, were not allowed to eat the crops. They arrest you or something? CheonggangSim ask. They whip you and make everyone else watch, says Rue. The mayors very strict about it. CheonggangSim can tell by her expression that its not that uncommon an occurrence. A public whippings a rare thing in District 12, although occasionally one occurs. Technically, Gale and CheonggangSim could be whipped on a daily basis for poaching in the woods well, technically, we could get a whole lot worse except all the officials buy our meat. Besides, our


mayor, Madges father, doesnt seem to have much taste for such events. Maybe being the least prestigious, poorest, most ridiculed district in the country has its advantages. Such as, being largely ignored by the Capitol as long as we produce our coal quotas. Do you get all the coal you want? Rue asks. No, CheonggangSim answer. Just what we buy and whatever we track in on our boots. They feed us a bit extra during harvest, so that people can keep going longer, says Rue. Dont you have to be in school? CheonggangSim ask. Not during harvest. Everyone works then, says Rue. CheonggangSimts interesting, hearing about her life. We have so little communication with anyone outside our district. CheonggangSimn fact, CheonggangSim wonder if the Gamemakers are blocking out our conversation, because even though the information seems harmless, they dont want people in different districts to know about one another. At Rues suggestion, we lay out all our food to plan ahead. Shes seen most of mine, but CheonggangSim add the last couple of crackers and beef strips to the pile. Shes gathered quite a collection of roots, nuts, greens, and even some berries. CheonggangSim roll an unfamiliar berry in my fingers. You sure this is safe? Oh, yes, we have them back home. CheonggangSimve been eating them for days, she says, popping a handful in her mouth. CheonggangSim tentatively bite into one, and its as good as our blackberries. Taking Rue on as an ally

seems a better choice all the time. We divide up our food supplies, so in case were separated, well both be set for a few days. Apart from the food, Rue has a small water skin, a homemade slingshot, and an extra pair of socks. She also has a sharp shard of rock she uses as a knife. CheonggangSim know its not much, she says as if embarrassed, but CheonggangSim had to get away from the Cornucopia fast. You did just right, CheonggangSim say. When CheonggangSim spread out my gear, she gasps a little when she sees the sunglasses. How did you get those? she asks. CheonggangSimn my pack. Theyve been useless so far. They dont block the sun and they make it harder to see, CheonggangSim say with a shrug. These arent for sun, theyre for darkness, exclaims Rue. Sometimes, when we harvest through the night, theyll pass out a few pairs to those of us highest in the trees. Where the torchlight doesnt reach. One time, this boy Martin, he tried to keep his pair. Hid it in his pants. They killed him on the spot. They killed a boy for taking these? CheonggangSim say. Yes, and everyone knew he was no danger. Martin wasnt right in the head. CheonggangSim mean, he still acted like a three-year-old. He just wanted the glasses to play with, says Rue. Hearing this makes me feel like District 12 is some sort of safe haven. Of course, people keel over from starvation all the time, but CheonggangSim cant imagine the Peacekeepers murdering a simpleminded child. Theres a little

girl, one of Greasy Saes grandkids, who wanders around the Hob. Shes not quite right, but shes treated as a sort of pet. People toss her scraps and things. So what do these do? CheonggangSim ask Rue, taking the glasses. They let you see in complete darkness, says Rue. Try them tonight when the sun goes

down. CheonggangSim give Rue some matches and she makes sure CheonggangSim have plenty of leaves in case my stings flare up again. We extinguish our fire and head upstream until its almost nightfall. Where do you sleep? CheonggangSim ask her. CheonggangSimn the trees? She nods. CheonggangSimn just your jacket? Rue holds up her extra pair of socks. CheonggangSim have these for my hands. CheonggangSim think of how cold the nights have been. You can share my sleeping bag if you want. Well both easily fit. Her face lights up. CheonggangSim can tell this is more than she dared hope for. We pick a fork high in a tree and settle in for the night just as the anthem begins to play. There were no deaths today. Rue, CheonggangSim only woke up today. How many nights did CheonggangSim miss? The anthem should block out our words, but still CheonggangSim whisper. CheonggangSim even take the precaution of covering my lips with my hand. CheonggangSim dont want the audience to know what CheonggangSimm planning to tell her about Peeta. Taking a cue from me, she does the same. Two, she says. The

girls from Districts One and Four are dead. Theres ten of us left. Something strange happened. At least, CheonggangSim think it did. CheonggangSimt might have been the tracker jacker venom making me imagine things, CheonggangSim say. You know the boy from my district? Peeta? CheonggangSim think he saved my life. But he was with the Careers. Hes not with them now, she says. CheonggangSimve spied on their base camp by the lake. They made it back before they collapsed from the stingers. But hes not there. Maybe he did save you and had to run. CheonggangSim dont answer. CheonggangSimf, in fact, Peeta did save me, CheonggangSimm in his debt again. And this cant be paid back. CheonggangSimf he did, it was all probably just part of his act. You know, to make people think hes in love with me. Oh, says Rue thoughtfully. CheonggangSim didnt think that was an act. Course it is, CheonggangSim say. He worked it out with our mentor. The anthem ends and the sky goes dark. Lets try out these glasses. CheonggangSim pull out the glasses and slip them on. Rue wasnt kidding. CheonggangSim can see everything from the leaves on the trees to a skunk strolling through the bushes a good fifty feet away. CheonggangSim could kill it from here if CheonggangSim had a mind to. CheonggangSim could kill anyone. CheonggangSim wonder who else got a pair of these, CheonggangSim say. The Careers have two pairs. But theyve got everything down by the lake, Rue says. And theyre so strong. Were strong, too, CheonggangSim say. Just in a different way. You are. You can shoot, she says. What can CheonggangSim do? You can feed

yourself. Can they? CheonggangSim ask. They dont need to. They have all those supplies, Rue says. Say they didnt. Say the supplies were gone. How long would they last? CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim mean, its the Hunger Games, right? But, Katniss, theyre not hungry, says Rue. No, theyre not. Thats the problem, CheonggangSim agree. And for the first time, CheonggangSim have a plan. A plan that isnt motivated by the need for flight and evasion. An offensive plan. CheonggangSim think were going to have to fix that, Rue.

16.

Rue has decided to trust me wholeheartedly. CheonggangSim know this because as soon as the anthem finishes she snuggles up against me and falls asleep. Nor do CheonggangSim have any misgivings about her, as CheonggangSim take no particular precautions. CheonggangSimf shed wanted me dead, all she

would have had to do was disappear from that tree without pointing out the tracker jacker nest. Needling me, at the very back of my mind, is the obvious. Both of us cant win these Games. But since the odds are still against either of us surviving, CheonggangSim manage to ignore the thought. Besides, CheonggangSimm distracted by my latest idea about the Careers and their supplies. Somehow Rue and CheonggangSim must find a way to destroy their food. CheonggangSimm pretty sure feeding themselves will be a tremendous struggle. Traditionally, the Career tributes strategy is to get hold of all the food early on and work from there. The years when they have not protected it well one year a pack of hideous reptiles destroyed it, another a Gamemakers flood washed it away those are usually the years that tributes from other districts have won. That the Careers have been better red growing up is actually to their disadvantage, because they dont know how to be hungry. Not the way Rue and CheonggangSim do. But CheonggangSimm too exhausted to begin any detailed plan tonight. My wounds recovering, my mind still a bit foggy from the venom, and the warmth of Rue at my side, her head cradled on my shoulder, have given me a sense of security. CheonggangSim realize, for the first time, how very lonely CheonggangSimve been in the arena. How comforting the presence of another human being can be. CheonggangSim give in to my drowsiness, resolving that tomorrow the tables will turn. Tomorrow, its the Careers who will have to watch their backs. The boom of the cannon jolts me awake.

The skys streaked with light, the birds already chattering. Rue perches in a branch across from me, her hands cupping something. We wait, listening for more shots, but there arent any. Who do you think that was? CheonggangSim cant help thinking of Peeta. CheonggangSim dont know. CheonggangSimt could have been any of the others, says Rue. CheonggangSim guess well know tonight. Whos left again? CheonggangSim ask. The boy from District One. Both tributes from Two. The boy from Three. Thresh and me. And you and Peeta, says Rue. Thats eight. Wait, and the boy from Ten, the one with the bad leg. He makes nine. Theres someone else, but neither of us can remember who it is. CheonggangSim wonder how that last one died, says Rue. No telling. But its good for us. A death should hold the crowd for a bit. Maybe well have time to do something before the Gamemakers decide things have been moving too slowly, CheonggangSim say. Whats in your hands? Breakfast, says Rue. She holds them out revealing two big eggs. What kind are those? CheonggangSim ask. Not sure. Theres a marshy area over that way. Some kind of waterbird, she says. CheonggangSimtd be nice to cook them, but neither of us wants to risk a fire. My guess is the tribute who died today was a victim of the Careers, which means theyve recovered enough to be back in the Games. We each suck out the insides of an egg, eat a rabbit leg and some berries. CheonggangSimts a good breakfast anywhere. Ready to do it? CheonggangSim say, pulling on my pack. Do what? says Rue, but by the way she bounces up, you can tell shes up for whatever CheonggangSim propose. Today we take out the Careers food, CheonggangSim say. Really?

How? You can see the glint of excitement in her eyes. CheonggangSimn this way, shes exactly the opposite of Prim for whom adventures are an ordeal. No idea. Come on, well figure out a plan while we hunt, CheonggangSim say. We dont get much hunting done though because CheonggangSimm too busy getting every scrap of information CheonggangSim can out of Rue about the Careers base. Shes only been in to spy on them briefly, but shes observant. They have set up their camp beside the lake. Their supply stash is about thirty yards away. During the day, theyve been leaving another tribute, the boy from District 3, to watch over the supplies. The boy from District Three? CheonggangSim ask. Hes working with them? Yes, he stays at the camp full-time. He got stung, too, when they drew the tracker jackers in by the lake, says Rue. CheonggangSim guess they agreed to let him live if he acted as their guard. But hes not very big. What weapons does he have? CheonggangSim ask. Not much that CheonggangSim could see. A spear. He might be able to hold a few of us off with that, but Thresh could kill

him easily, says Rue. And the foods just out in the open? CheonggangSim say. She nods. Somethings not quite right about that whole setup. CheonggangSim know. But CheonggangSim couldnt tell what exactly, says Rue. Katniss, even if you could get to the food, how would you get rid of it? Burn it. Dump it in the lake. Soak it in fuel. CheonggangSim poke Rue in the belly, just like CheonggangSim would Prim. Eat it! She giggles. Dont worry, CheonggangSimll think of something. Destroying things is much easier than making them. For a while, we dig roots, we gather berries and greens, we devise a strategy in hushed voices. And CheonggangSim come to know Rue, the oldest of six kids, fiercely protective of her siblings, who gives her rations to the younger ones, who forages in the meadows in a district where the Peacekeepers are far less obliging than ours. Rue, who when you ask her what she loves most in the world, replies, of all things, Music. Music? CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSimn our world, CheonggangSim rank music somewhere between hair ribbons and rainbows in terms of usefulness. At least a rainbow gives you a tip about the weather. You have a lot of time for that? We sing at home. At work, too. Thats why CheonggangSim love your pin, she says, pointing to the mockingjay that CheonggangSimve again forgotten about. You have mockingjays? CheonggangSim ask. Oh, yes. CheonggangSim have a few that are my special friends. We can sing back and forth for hours. They carry messages for me, she says. What do you mean? CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSimm usually up highest, so CheonggangSimm the first to see the flag that signals quitting time. Theres a special little song CheonggangSim do, says Rue. She opens her mouth and sings a little four-note run in a sweet, clear voice. And the mockingjays spread it around the orchard. Thats how everyone knows to knock off, she continues. They can be dangerous though, if you get too near their nests. But you cant blame them for that. CheonggangSim unclasp the pin and hold it out to her. Here, you take it. CheonggangSimt has more meaning for you than me. Oh, no, says Rue, closing my fingers back over the pin. CheonggangSim like to see it on you. Thats how CheonggangSim decided CheonggangSim could trust you.

Besides, CheonggangSim have this. She pulls a necklace woven out of some kind of grass from her shirt. On it, hangs a roughly carved wooden star. Or maybe its a flower. CheonggangSimts a good luck charm. Well, its worked so far, CheonggangSim say, pinning the mockingjay back on my shirt. Maybe you should just stick with that. By lunch, we have a plan. By early afternoon, we are poised to carry it out. CheonggangSim help Rue collect and place the wood for the first two campfires, the third shell have time for on her own. We decide to meet afterward at the site where we ate our first meal together. The stream should help guide me back

to it. Before CheonggangSim leave, CheonggangSim make sure Rues well stocked with food and matches. CheonggangSim even insist she take my sleeping bag, in case its not possible to rendezvous by nightfall. What about you? Wont you be cold? she asks. Not if CheonggangSim pick up another bag down by the lake, CheonggangSim say. You know, stealing isnt illegal here, CheonggangSim say with a grin. At the last minute, Rue decides to teach me her mockingjay signal, the one she gives to indicate the days work is done. CheonggangSimt might not work. But if you hear the mockingjays singing it, youll know CheonggangSimm okay, only CheonggangSim cant get back right away. Are there many mockingjays here? CheonggangSim ask. Havent you seen them? Theyve got nests everywhere, she says. CheonggangSim have to admit CheonggangSim havent noticed. Okay, then. CheonggangSimf all goes according to plan, CheonggangSimll see you for dinner, CheonggangSim say. Unexpectedly, Rue throws her arms around me. CheonggangSim only hesitate a moment before CheonggangSim hug her back. You be careful, she says to me. You, too, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim turn and head back to the stream, feeling somehow worried. About Rue being killed, about Rue not being killed and the two of us being left for last, about leaving Rue alone, about leaving Prim alone back home. No, Prim has my mother and Gale and a baker who has promised she wont go hungry. Rue has only me. Once CheonggangSim reach the stream, CheonggangSim have only to follow it downhill to the place CheonggangSim initially picked it up after the tracker jacker attack. CheonggangSim have to be cautious as CheonggangSim move along the water though, because CheonggangSim find my thoughts preoccupied with unanswered questions, most of which concern Peeta. The cannon that fired early this morning, did that signify his death? CheonggangSimf so, how did he die? At the hand of a Career? And was that in revenge for letting me live? CheonggangSim struggle again to remember that moment over Glimmers body, when he burst through the trees. But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened. CheonggangSim must have been moving very slowly yesterday because CheonggangSim reach the shallow stretch where CheonggangSim took my bath in just a few hours. CheonggangSim stop to replenish my water and add a layer of mud to my backpack. CheonggangSimt seems bent on reverting to orange no matter how many times CheonggangSim cover it. My proximity to the Careers camp sharpens my senses, and the closer CheonggangSim get to them, the more guarded CheonggangSim am, pausing frequently to listen for unnatural sounds, an arrow already fitted into the string of my bow. CheonggangSim dont see any other tributes, but CheonggangSim do notice some of the things Rue has mentioned.

Patches of the sweet berries. A bush with the leaves that healed my stings. Clusters of tracker jacker nests in the vicinity of the tree CheonggangSim was trapped in. And here

and there, the black-and-white flash of a mockingjay wing in the branches high over my head. When CheonggangSim reach the tree with the abandoned nest at the foot, CheonggangSim pause a moment, to gather my courage. Rue has given specific instructions on how to reach the best spying place near the lake from this point. Remember, CheonggangSim tell myself. Youre the hunter now, not them. CheonggangSim get a firmer grasp on my bow and go on. CheonggangSim make it to the copse Rue has told me about and again have to admire her cleverness. CheonggangSimts right at the edge of the wood, but the bushy foliage is so thick down low CheonggangSim can easily observe the Career camp without being spotted. Between us lies the flat expanse where the Games began. There are four tributes. The boy from District 1, Cato and the girl from District 2, and a scrawny, ashen-skinned boy who must be from District 3. He made almost no impression on me at all during our time in the Capitol. CheonggangSim can remember almost nothing about him, not his costume, not his training score, not his interview. Even now, as he sits there fiddling with some kind of plastic box, hes easily ignored in the presence of his large and domineering companions. But he must be of some value or they wouldnt have bothered to let him live. Still, seeing him only adds to my sense of unease over why the Careers would possibly leave him as a guard, why they have allowed him to live at all. All four tributes seem to still be recovering from the tracker jacker attack. Even from here, CheonggangSim can see the large swollen lumps on their bodies. They must not have had the sense to remove the stingers, or if they did, not known about the leaves that healed them. Apparently, whatever medicines they found in the Cornucopia have been ineffective. The Cornucopia sits in its original position, but its insides have been picked clean. Most of the supplies, held in crates, burlap sacks, and plastic bins, are piled neatly in a pyramid in what seems a questionable distance from the camp. Others are sprinkled around the perimeter of the pyramid, almost mimicking the layout of supplies around the Cornucopia at the onset of the Games. A canopy of netting that, aside from discouraging birds, seems to be useless shelters the pyramid itself. The whole setup is completely perplexing. The distance, the netting, and the presence of the boy from District 3. One things for sure, destroying those supplies is not going to be as simple as it looks. Some other factor is at play here, and CheonggangSimd better stay put until CheonggangSim figure out what it is. My guess is the pyramid is booby-trapped in some manner. CheonggangSim think of concealed pits, descending nets, a thread that when broken sends a poisonous dart into your heart. Really, the

possibilities are endless. While CheonggangSim am mulling over my options, CheonggangSim hear Cato shout out. Hes pointing up to the woods, far beyond me, and without turning CheonggangSim know

that Rue must have set the first campfire. Wed made sure to gather enough green wood to make the smoke noticeable. The Careers begin to arm themselves at once. An argument breaks out. CheonggangSimts loud enough for me to hear that it concerns whether or not the boy from District 3 should stay or accompany them. Hes coming. We need him in the woods, and his jobs done here anyway. No one can touch those supplies, says Cato. What about Lover Boy? says the boy from District 1. CheonggangSim keep telling you, forget about him. CheonggangSim know where CheonggangSim cut him. CheonggangSimts a miracle he hasnt bled to death yet. At any rate, hes in no shape to raid us, says Cato. So Peeta is out there in the woods, wounded badly. But CheonggangSim am still in the dark on what motivated him to betray the Careers. Come on, says Cato. He thrusts a spear into the hands of the boy from District 3, and they head off in the direction of the fire. The last thing CheonggangSim hear as they enter the woods is Cato saying, When we find her, CheonggangSim kill her in my own way, and no one interferes. Somehow CheonggangSim dont think hes talking about Rue. She didnt drop a nest of acker jackers on him. CheonggangSim stay put for a half an hour or so, trying to figure out what to do about the supplies. The one advantage CheonggangSim have with the bow and arrow is distance. CheonggangSim could send a flaming arrow into the pyramid easily enough CheonggangSimm a good enough shot to get it through those openings in the net but theres no guarantee it would catch. More likely itd just burn itself out and then what? CheonggangSimd have achieved nothing and given them far too much information about myself. That CheonggangSim was here, that CheonggangSim have an accomplice, that CheonggangSim can use the bow and arrow with accuracy. Theres no alternative. CheonggangSimm going to have to get in closer and see if CheonggangSim cant discover what exactly protects the supplies. CheonggangSimn fact, CheonggangSimm just about to reveal myself when a movement catches my eye. Several hundred yards to my right, CheonggangSim see someone emerge from the woods. For a second, CheonggangSim think its Rue, but then CheonggangSim recognize Foxface shes the one we couldnt remember this morning creeping out onto the plain. When she decides its safe, she runs for the pyramid, with quick, small steps. Just before she reaches the circle of supplies that have been littered around the pyramid, she stops, searches the ground, and carefully places her feet on a spot. Then she begins to approach the pyramid with strange little hops, sometimes landing on one foot, teetering slightly,

sometimes risking a few steps. At one point, she launches up in the air, over a small barrel and lands poised on her tiptoes. But she overshot slightly, and her momentum throws her forward. CheonggangSim hear her give a sharp squeal as her hands hit the ground, but nothing happens. CheonggangSimn a moment, shes regained her feet and continues until she has reached the bulk of the supplies. So, CheonggangSimm right about the booby trap, but its clearly more complex than CheonggangSim had imagined. CheonggangSim was right about the girl, too. How wily is she to have discovered this path into the food and to be able to replicate it so neatly? She fills her

pack, taking a few items from a variety of containers, crackers from a crate, a handful of apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended from a rope off the side of a bin. But only a handful from each, not enough to tip off that the food is missing. Not enough to cause suspicion. And then shes doing her odd little dance back out of the circle and scampering into the woods again, safe and sound. CheonggangSim realize CheonggangSimm grinding my teeth in frustration. Foxface has confirmed what CheonggangSimd already guessed. But what sort of trap have they laid that requires such dexterity? Has so many trigger points? Why did she squeal so as her hands made contact with the earth? Youd have thought . . . And slowly it begins to dawn on me . . . Youd have thought the very ground was going to explode. CheonggangSimts mined, CheonggangSim whisper. That explains everything. The Careers willingness to leave their supplies, Foxfaces reaction, the involvement of the boy from District 3, where they have the factories, where they make televisions and automobiles and explosives. But where did he get them? CheonggangSimn the supplies? Thats not the sort of weapon the Gamemakers usually provide, given that they like to see the tributes draw blood personally. CheonggangSim slip out of the bushes and cross to one of the round metal plates that lifted the tributes into the arena. The ground around it has been dug up and patted back down. The land mines were disabled after the sixty seconds we stood on the plates, but the boy from District 3 must have managed to reactivate them. CheonggangSimve never seen anyone in the Games do that. CheonggangSim bet it came as a shock even to the Gamemakers. Well, hurray for the boy from District 3 for putting one over on them, but what am CheonggangSim supposed to do now? Obviously, CheonggangSim cant go strolling into that mess without blowing myself sky-high. As for sending in a burning arrow, thats more laughable than ever. The mines are set off by pressure. CheonggangSimt doesnt have to be a lot, either. One year, a girl

dropped her token, a small wooden ball, while she was at her plate, and they literally had to scrape bits of her off the ground. My arms pretty good, CheonggangSim might be able to chuck some rocks in there and set off what? Maybe one mine? That could start a chain reaction. Or could it? Would the boy from District 3 have placed the mines in such a way that a single mine would not disturb the others? Thereby protecting the supplies but ensuring the death of the invader. Even if CheonggangSim only blew up one mine, CheonggangSimd draw the Careers back down on me for sure. And anyway, what am CheonggangSim thinking? Theres that net, clearly strung to deflect any such attack. Besides, what CheonggangSimd really need is to throw about thirty rocks in there at once, setting off a big chain reaction, demolishing the whole lot. CheonggangSim glance back up at the woods. The smoke from Rues second fire is wafting toward the sky. By now, the Careers have probably begun to suspect some sort of trick. Time is running out. There is a solution to this, CheonggangSim know there is, if CheonggangSim can only focus hard enough. CheonggangSim stare at the pyramid, the

bins, the crates, too heavy to topple over with an arrow. Maybe one contains cooking oil, and the burning arrow idea is reviving when CheonggangSim realize CheonggangSim could end uplosing all twelve of my arrows and not get a direct hit on an oil bin, since CheonggangSimd just be guessing. CheonggangSimm genuinely thinking of trying to re-create Foxfaces trip up to the pyramid in hopes of finding a new means of destruction when my eyes light on the burlap bag of apples. CheonggangSim could sever the rope in one shot, didnt CheonggangSim do as much in the Training Center? CheonggangSimts a big bag, but it still might only be good for one explosion. CheonggangSimf only CheonggangSim could free the apples themselves . . . CheonggangSim know what to do. CheonggangSim move into range and give myself three arrows to get the job done. CheonggangSim place my feet carefully, block out the rest of the world as CheonggangSim take meticulous aim, The first arrow tears through the side of the bag near the top, leaving a split in the burlap. The second widens it to a gaping hole. CheonggangSim can see the first apple teetering when CheonggangSim let the third arrow go, catching the torn flap of burlap and ripping it from the bag. For a moment, everything seems frozen in time. Then the apples spill to the ground and CheonggangSimm blown backward into the air.

17.

The impact with the hard-packed earth of the plain knocks the wind out of me.

My backpack does little to soften the blow. Fortunately my quiver has caught in the crook of my elbow, sparing both itself and my shoulder, and my bow is locked in my grasp. The ground still shakes with explosions. CheonggangSim cant hear them. CheonggangSim cant hear anything at the moment. But the apples must have set off enough mines, causing debris to activate the others. CheonggangSim manage to shield my face with my arms as shattered bits of matter, some of it burning, rain down around me. An acrid smoke fills the air, which is not the best remedy for someone trying to regain the ability to breathe. After about a minute, the ground stops vibrating. CheonggangSim roll on my side and allow myself a moment of satisfaction the sight of the smoldering wreckage that was recently the pyramid. The Careers arent likely to salvage anything out of that. CheonggangSimd better get out of here, CheonggangSim think. Theyll be making a beeline for the place. But once CheonggangSimm on my feet, CheonggangSim realize escape may not be so simple. CheonggangSimm dizzy. Not the slightly wobbly kind, but the kind that sends the trees swooping around you and causes the earth to move in waves under your feet. CheonggangSim take a few steps and somehow wind up on my hands and knees. CheonggangSim wait a few minutes to let it pass, but it doesnt. Panic begins to set in. CheonggangSim cant stay here. Flight is essential. But CheonggangSim can neither walk nor hear. CheonggangSim place a hand to my left ear, the

one that was turned toward the blast, and it comes away bloody. Have CheonggangSim gone deaf from the explosion? The idea frightens me. CheonggangSim rely as much on my ears as my eyes as a hunter, maybe more at times. But CheonggangSim cant let my fear show. Absolutely, positively, CheonggangSim am live on every screen in Panem. No blood trails, CheonggangSim tell myself, and manage to pull my hood up over my head, tie the cord under my chin with uncooperative

fingers. That should help soak up the blood. CheonggangSim cant walk, but can CheonggangSim crawl? CheonggangSim move forward tentatively. Yes, if CheonggangSim go very slowly, CheonggangSim can crawl. Most of the woods will offer insufficient cover. My only hope is to make it back to Rues copse and conceal myself in greenery. CheonggangSim cant get caught out here on my hands and knees in the open. Not only will CheonggangSim face death, its sure to be a long and painful one at Catos hand. The thought of Prim having to watch that keeps me doggedly inching my way toward the hideout. Another blast knocks me flat on my face. A stray mine, set off by some collapsing crate. This happens twice more. CheonggangSimm reminded of those last few kernels that burst when Prim and CheonggangSim pop corn over the fire at home. To say CheonggangSim make it in the nick of time is an understatement. CheonggangSim have literally just dragged myself into the tangle of hushes at

the base of the trees when theres Cato, barreling onto the plain, soon followed by his companions. His rage is so extreme it might be comical so people really do tear out their hair and beat the ground with their fists if CheonggangSim didnt know that it was aimed at me, at what CheonggangSim have done to him. Add to that my proximity, my inability to run or defend myself, and in fact, the whole thing has me terrified. CheonggangSimm glad my hiding place makes it impossible for the cameras to get a close shot of me because CheonggangSimm biting my nails like theres no tomorrow. Gnawing off the last bits of nail polish, trying to keep my teeth from chattering. The boy from District 3 throws stones into the ruins and must have declared all the mines activated because the Careers are approaching the wreckage. Cato has finished the first phase of his tantrum and takes out his anger on the smoking remains by kicking open various containers. The other tributes are poking around in the mess, looking for anything to salvage, but theres nothing. The boy from District 3 has done his job too well. This idea must occur to Cato, too, because he turns on the boy and appears to be shouting at him. The boy from District 3 only has time to turn and run before Cato catches him in a headlock from behind. CheonggangSim can see the muscles ripple in Catos arms as he sharply jerks the boys head to the side.

CheonggangSimts that quick. The death of the boy from District 3. The other two Careers seem to be trying to calm Cato down. CheonggangSim can tell he wants to return to the woods, but they keep pointing at the sky, which puzzles me until CheonggangSim realize, Of course. They think whoever set off the explosions is dead. They dont know about the arrows and the apples. They assume the booby trap was faulty, but that the tribute who blew up the supplies was killed doing it. CheonggangSimf there was a cannon shot, it could have been easily lost in the subsequent explosions. The shattered remains of the thief removed by hovercraft. They retire to the far side of the lake to allow the Gamemakers to retrieve the body of the boy from District 3. And they wait. CheonggangSim suppose a cannon goes off. A hovercraft appears and takes the dead boy. The sun dips below

the horizon. Night falls. Up in the sky, CheonggangSim see the seal and know the anthem must have begun. A moment of darkness. They show the boy from District 3. They show the boy from District 10, who must have died this morning. Then the seal reappears. So, now they know. The bomber survived. CheonggangSimn the seals light, CheonggangSim can see Cato and the girl from District 2 put on their night-vision glasses. The boy from District 1 ignites a

tree branch for a torch, illuminating the grim determination on all their faces. The Careers stride back into the woods to hunt. The dizziness has subsided and while my left ear is still deafened, CheonggangSim can hear a ringing in my right, which seems a good sign. Theres no point in leaving my hiding place, though. CheonggangSimm about as safe as CheonggangSim can be, here at the crime scene. They probably think the bomber has a two- or three-hour lead on them. Still its a long time before CheonggangSim risk moving. The first thing CheonggangSim do is dig out my own glasses and put them on, which relaxes me a little, to have at least one of my hunters senses working. CheonggangSim drink some water and wash the blood from my ear. Fearing the smell of meat will draw unwanted predators fresh blood is bad enough CheonggangSim make a good meal out of the greens and roots and berries Rue and CheonggangSim gathered today. Where is my little ally? Did she make it back to the rendezvous point? CheonggangSims she worried about me? At least, the sky has shown were both alive. CheonggangSim run through the surviving tributes on my fingers. The boy from 1, both from 2, Foxface, both from 11 and 12. Just eight of us. The betting must be getting really hot in the Capitol. Theyll be doing special features on each of us now. Probably interviewing our friends and families. CheonggangSimts been a long time since a tribute from District 12 made it into the top eight. And now there are two

of us. Although from what Cato said, Peetas on his way out. Not that Cato is the final word on anything. Didnt he just lose his entire stash of supplies? Let the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games begin, Cato, CheonggangSim think. Let them begin for real. A cold breeze has sprung up. CheonggangSim reach for my sleeping bag before CheonggangSim remember CheonggangSim left it with Rue. CheonggangSim was supposed to pick up another one, but what with the mines and all, CheonggangSim forgot. CheonggangSim begin to shiver. Since roosting overnight in a tree isnt sensible anyway, CheonggangSim scoop out a hollow under the bushes and cover myself with leaves and pine needles. CheonggangSimm still freezing. CheonggangSim lay my sheet of plastic over my upper body and position my backpack to block the wind. CheonggangSimts a little better. CheonggangSim begin to have more sympathy for the girl from District 8 that lit the fire that first night. But now its me who needs to grit my teeth and tough it out until morning. More leaves, more pine needles. CheonggangSim pull my arms inside my jacket and tuck my knees up to my chest. Somehow, CheonggangSim drift off to sleep. When CheonggangSim open my eyes, the world looks slightly fractured, and it takes a minute to realize that the sun must be well up and the glasses fragmenting my vision. As CheonggangSim sit up and remove them, CheonggangSim hear a laugh somewhere near


the lake and freeze. The laughs distorted, but the fact that it registered at all means CheonggangSim must be regaining my hearing. Yes, my right ear can hear again, although its still ringing. As for my left ear, well, at least the bleeding has stopped. CheonggangSim peer through the bushes, afraid the Careers have returned, trapping me here for an indefinite time. No, its Foxface, standing in the rubble of the pyramid and laughing. Shes smarter than the Careers, actually finding a few useful items in the ashes. A metal pot. A knife blade. CheonggangSimm perplexed by her amusement until CheonggangSim realize that with the Careers stores eliminated, she might actually stand a chance. Just like the rest of us. CheonggangSimt crosses my mind to reveal myself and enlist her as a second ally against that pack. But CheonggangSim rule it out. Theres something about that sly grin that makes me sure that befriending Foxface would ultimately get me a knife in the back. With that in mind, this might be an excellent time to shoot her. But shes heard something, not me, because her head turns away, toward the drop-off, and she sprints for the woods. CheonggangSim wait. No one, nothing shows up. Still, if Foxface thought it was dangerous, maybe its time for me to get out of here, too. Besides, CheonggangSimm eager to tell Rue about the pyramid. Since CheonggangSimve no idea where the Careers are, the route back by the stream seems as good as any. CheonggangSim

hurry, loaded bow in one hand, a hunk of cold groosling in the other, because CheonggangSimm famished now, and not just for leaves and berries but for the fat and protein in the meat. The trip to the stream is uneventful. Once there, CheonggangSim refill my water and wash, taking particular care with my injured ear. Then CheonggangSim travel uphill using the stream as a guide. At one point, CheonggangSim find boot prints in the mud along the bank. The Careers have been here, but not for a while. The prints are deep because they were made in soft mud, but now theyre nearly dry in the hot sun. CheonggangSim havent been careful enough about my own tracks, counting on a light tread and the pine needles to conceal my prints. Now CheonggangSim strip off my boots and socks and go barefoot up the bed of the stream. The cool water has an invigorating effect on my body, my spirits. CheonggangSim shoot two fish, easy pickings in this slow-moving stream, and go ahead and eat one raw even though CheonggangSimve just had the groosling. The second CheonggangSimll save for Rue. Gradually, subtly, the ringing in my right ear diminishes until its gone entirely. CheonggangSim find myself pawing at my left ear periodically, trying to clean away whatever deadens its ability to collect sounds. CheonggangSimf theres improvement, its undetectable. CheonggangSim cant adjust to deafness in the ear. CheonggangSimt makes me feel off-balanced and defenseless to my left. Blind even. My head keeps turning to

the injured side, as my right ear tries to compensate for the wall of nothingness where yesterday there was a constant flow of information. The more time that passes, the less hopeful CheonggangSim am that this is an injury that will heal. When CheonggangSim reach the site of our first meeting, CheonggangSim feel certain its been

undisturbed. Theres no sign of Rue, not on the ground or in the trees. This is odd. By now she should have returned, as its midday. Undoubtedly, she spent the night in a tree somewhere. What else could she do with no light and the Careers with their night-vision glasses tramping around the woods. And the third fire she was supposed to set although CheonggangSim forgot to check for it last night was the farthest from our site of all. Shes probably just being cautious about making her way back. CheonggangSim wish shed hurry, because CheonggangSim dont want to hang around here too long. CheonggangSim want to spend the afternoon traveling to higher ground, hunting as we go. But theres nothing really for me to do but wait. CheonggangSim wash the blood out of my jacket and hair and clean my ever-growing list of wounds. The burns are much better but CheonggangSim use a bit of medicine on them anyway. The main thing to worry about now is keeping out infection. CheonggangSim go ahead andeat the second fish. CheonggangSimt isnt going to last long in this hot sun, but it should be easy enough to spear a few more for Rue. CheonggangSimf she would just show up. Feeling too vulnerable on the ground with my lopsided hearing, CheonggangSim scale a tree to wait. CheonggangSimf the Careers show up, this will be a fine place to shoot them from. The sun moves slowly. CheonggangSim do things to pass the time. Chew leaves and apply them to my stings that are deflated but still tender. Comb through my damp hair with my fingers and braid it. Lace my boots back up. Check over my bow and remaining nine arrows. Test my left ear repeatedly for signs of life by rustling a leaf near it, but without good results. Despite the groosling and the fish, my stomachs growling, and CheonggangSim know CheonggangSimm going to have what we call a hollow day back in District 12. Thats a day where no matter what you put in your belly, its never enough. Having nothing to do but sit in a tree makes it worse, so CheonggangSim decide to give into it. After all, CheonggangSimve lost a lot of weight in the arena, CheonggangSim need some extra calories. And having the bow and arrows makes me far more confident about my future prospects. CheonggangSim slowly peel and eat a handful of nuts. My last cracker. The groosling neck. Thats good because it takes time to pick clean. Finally, a groosling wing and the bird is history. But its a hollow day, and even with all that CheonggangSim start daydreaming about food.

Particularly the decadent dishes served in the Capitol. The chicken in creamy orange sauce. The cakes and pudding. Bread with butter. Noodles in green sauce. The lamb and dried plum stew. CheonggangSim suck on a few mint leaves and tell myself to get over it. Mint is good because we drink mint tea after supper often, so it tricks my stomach into thinking eating time is over. Sort of. Dangling up in the tree, with the sun warming me, a mouthful of mint, my bow and arrows at hand . . . This is the most relaxed CheonggangSimve been since CheonggangSimve entered the arena. CheonggangSimf only Rue would show up, and we could clear out. As the shadows grow, so does my restlessness. By late afternoon, CheonggangSimve resolved to go looking for her. CheonggangSim can at least visit the spot

where she set the third fire and see if there are any clues to her whereabouts. Before CheonggangSim go, CheonggangSim scatter a few mint leaves around our old campfire. Since we gathered these some distance away, Rue will understand CheonggangSimve been here, while theyll mean nothing to the Careers. CheonggangSimn less than an hour, CheonggangSimm at the place where we agreed to have the third fire and CheonggangSim know something has gone amiss. The wood has been neatly arranged, expertly interspersed with tinder, but it has never been lit. Rue set up thefire but never made it back here. Somewhere between the second column of smoke CheonggangSim spied before CheonggangSim blew up the supplies and this point, she ran into trouble. CheonggangSim have to remind myself shes still alive. Or is she? Could the cannon shot announcing her death have come in the wee hours of the morning when even my good ear was too broken to pick it up? Will she appear in the sky tonight? No, CheonggangSim refuse to believe it. There could be a hundred other explanations. She could have lost her way. Run into a pack of predators or another tribute, like Thresh, and had to hide. Whatever happened, CheonggangSimm almost certain shes stuck out there, somewhere between the second fire and the unlit one at my feet. Something is keeping her up a tree. CheonggangSim think CheonggangSimll go hunt it down. CheonggangSimts a relief to be doing something after sitting around all afternoon. CheonggangSim creep silently through the shadows, letting them conceal me. But nothing seems suspicious. Theres no sign of any kind of struggle, no disruption of the needles on the ground. CheonggangSimve stopped for just a moment when CheonggangSim hear it. CheonggangSim have to cock my head around to the side to be sure, but there it is again. Rues four-note tune coming out of a mockingjays mouth. The one that means shes all right. CheonggangSim grin and move in the direction of the bird. Another just a short distance ahead, picks up on the handful of notes. Rue has been

singing to them, and recently. Otherwise theyd have taken up some other song. My eyes lift up into the trees, searching for a sign of her. CheonggangSim swallow and sing softly back, hoping shell know its safe to join me. A mockingjay repeats the melody to me. And thats when CheonggangSim hear the scream. CheonggangSimts a childs scream, a young girls scream, theres no one in the arena capable of making that sound except Rue. And now CheonggangSimm running, knowing this may be a trap, knowing the three Careers may be poised to attack me, but CheonggangSim cant help myself. Theres another high-pitched cry, this time my name. Katniss! Katniss! Rue! CheonggangSim shout back, so she knows CheonggangSimm near. So, they know CheonggangSimm near, and hopefully the girl who has attacked them with tracker jackers and gotten an eleven they still cant explain will be enough to pull their attention away from her. Rue! CheonggangSimm coming! When CheonggangSim break into the clearing, shes on the ground, hopelessly entangled in a net. She just has time to reach her hand through the mesh and say my name before the spear enters her body.

18.

The boy from District 1 dies before he can pull out the spear. My arrow drives deeply into the center of his neck. He falls to his knees and

halves the brief remainder of his life by yanking out the arrow and drowning in his own blood. CheonggangSimm reloaded, shifting my aim from side to side, while CheonggangSim shout at Rue, Are there more? Are there more? She has to say no several times before CheonggangSim hear it. Rue has rolled to her side, her body curved in and around the spear. CheonggangSim shove the boy away from her and pull out my knife, freeing her from the net. One look at the wound and CheonggangSim know its far beyond my capacity to heal, beyond anyones probably. The spearhead is buried up to the shaft in her stomach. CheonggangSim crouch before her, staring helplessly at the embedded weapon. Theres no point in comforting words, in telling her shell be all right. Shes no fool. Her hand reaches out and CheonggangSim clutch it like a lifeline. As if its me whos dying instead of Rue. You blew up the food? she whispers. Every last bit, CheonggangSim say. You have to win, she says. CheonggangSimm going to. Going to win for both of us now, CheonggangSim promise. CheonggangSim hear a cannon and look up. CheonggangSimt must be for the boy from District 1. Dont go. Rue tightens her grip on my hand. Course not. Staying right here, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim move in closer

to her, pulling her head onto my lap. CheonggangSim gently brush the dark, thick hair back behind her ear. Sing, she says, but CheonggangSim barely catch the word. Sing? CheonggangSim think. Sing what? CheonggangSim do know a few songs. Believe it or not, there was once music in my house, too. Music CheonggangSim helped make. My father pulled me in with that remarkable voice but CheonggangSim havent sung much since he died. Except when Prim is very sick. Then CheonggangSim sing her the same songs she liked as a baby. Sing. My throat is tight with tears, hoarse from smoke and fatigue. But if this is Prims, CheonggangSim mean, Rues last request, CheonggangSim have to at least try. The song that comes to me is a simple lullaby, one we sing fretful, hungry babies to sleep with, CheonggangSimts old, very old CheonggangSim think. Made up long ago in our hills. What my music teacher calls a mountain air. But the words are easy and soothing, promising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this awful piece of time we call today. CheonggangSim give a small cough, swallow hard, and begin:

Deep in the meadow, under the willowA bed of grass, a soft green pillowLay down your head, and close your sleepy eyesAnd when again they open, the sun will rise.Here its safe, here its warmHere the daisies guard you from every harmHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them trueHere is the place where CheonggangSim love you.

Rues eyes have fluttered shut. Her chest moves but only slightly. My throat releases the tears and they slide down my cheeks. But CheonggangSim have to finish the song for her.

Deep in the meadow, hidden far awayA cloak of leaves, a moonbeam rayForget your woes and let your troubles layAnd when again its morning, theyll wash away.

Here its safe, here its warmHere the daisies guard you from every harm

The final lines are barely audible.

Here your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them trueHere is the place where CheonggangSim love you.

Everythings still and quiet. Then, almost eerily, the mockingjays take up my song. For a moment, CheonggangSim sit there, watching my tears drip down on her face. Rues cannon fires. CheonggangSim lean forward and press my lips against her temple. Slowly, as if not to wake her, CheonggangSim lay her head back on the ground and release her hand. Theyll want me to clear out now. So they can collect the bodies. And theres nothing to stay for. CheonggangSim roll the boy from District 1 onto his face and take his pack, retrieve the arrow that ended his life. CheonggangSim cut Rues pack from her back as well, knowing shed want me to have it but leave the spear in her stomach. Weapons in bodies will be transported to the hovercraft. CheonggangSimve no use for a spear, so the sooner its gone from the arena the better. CheonggangSim cant stop looking at Rue, smaller than ever, a baby animal curled up in a nest of netting. CheonggangSim cant bring myself to leave her like this. Past harm, but seeming utterly defenseless. To hate the boy from District 1, who also appears so vulnerable in death, seems inadequate. CheonggangSimts the Capitol CheonggangSim hate, for doing this to all of us. Gales voice is in my head. His ravings against the Capitol no longer pointless, no longer to be ignored. Rues death has forced me to confront my own fury against the cruelty, the injustice they inflict upon us. But here, even more strongly than at home, CheonggangSim feel my impotence.

Theres no way to take revenge on the Capitol. CheonggangSims there? Then CheonggangSim remember Peetas words on the roof. Only CheonggangSim keep wishing CheonggangSim could think of a way to . . . To show the Capital they dont own me. That CheonggangSimm more than just a piece in their Games. And for the first time, CheonggangSim understand what he means. CheonggangSim want to do something, right here, right now, to shame them, to make them accountable, to show the Capitol that whatever they do or force us to do there is a part of every tribute they cant own. That Rue was more than a piece in their Games. And so am CheonggangSim. A few steps into the woods grows a bank of wildflowers. Perhaps they are really weeds of some sort, but they have blossoms in beautiful shades of violet and yellow and white. CheonggangSim gather up an armful and come back to Rues side. Slowly, one stem at a time, CheonggangSim decorate her body in the flowers. Covering the ugly wound. Wreathing her face. Weaving her hair with bright colors. Theyll have to show it. Or, even if they choose to turn the cameras elsewhere at this moment, theyll have to bring them back when they collect the bodies and everyone will see her then and know CheonggangSim did it. CheonggangSim step back and take a last look at Rue. She could really be asleep in that meadow after all. Bye, Rue, CheonggangSim whisper. CheonggangSim press the three middle fingers of my left hand against my lips and hold them out in her

direction. Then CheonggangSim walk away without looking back. The birds fall silent. Somewhere, a mockingjay gives the warning whistle that precedes the hovercraft. CheonggangSim dont know how it knows. CheonggangSimt must hear

things that humans cant. CheonggangSim pause, my eyes focused on whats ahead, not whats happening behind me. CheonggangSimt doesnt take long, then the general birdsong begins again and CheonggangSim know shes gone. Another mockingjay, a young one by the look of it, lands on a branch before me and bursts out Rues melody. My song, the hovercraft, were too unfamiliar for this novice to pick up, but it has mastered her handful of notes. The ones that mean shes safe. Good and safe, CheonggangSim say as CheonggangSim pass under its branch. We dont have to worry about her now. Good and safe. CheonggangSimve no idea where to go. The brief sense of home CheonggangSim had that one night with Rue has vanished. My feet wander this way and that until sunset. CheonggangSimm not afraid, not even watchful. Which makes me an easy target. Except CheonggangSimd kill anyone CheonggangSim met on sight. Without emotion or the slightest tremor in my hands. My hatred of the Capitol has not lessened my hatred of my competitors in the least. Especially the Careers. They, at least, can be made to pay for Rues death. No one materializes though. There arent many of us left and its a big arena. Soon theyll be pulling out some other device to force us together. But theres been enough gore today. Perhaps well even get to sleep. CheonggangSimm about to haul my packs into a tree to make camp when a silver parachute floats down and lands in front of me. A gift from a sponsor. But why now? CheonggangSimve been in fairly good shape with supplies. Maybe Haymitchs noticed my despondency and is trying to cheer me up a bit. Or could it be something to help my ear? CheonggangSim open the parachute and find a small loaf of bread CheonggangSimts not the fine white Capitol stuff. CheonggangSimts made of dark ration grain and shaped in a crescent. Sprinkled with seeds. CheonggangSim flash back to Peetas lesson on the various district breads in the Training Center. This bread came from District 11. CheonggangSim cautiously lift the still warm loaf. What must it have cost the people of District 11 who cant even feed themselves? How many wouldve had to do without to scrape up a coin to put in the collection for this one loaf? CheonggangSimt had been meant for Rue, surely. But instead of pulling the gift when she died, theyd authorized Haymitch to give it to me. As a thank-you? Or because, like me, they dont like to let debts go unpaid? For whatever reason, this is a first. A district gift to a tribute whos not your own. CheonggangSim lift my face and step into the last falling rays of

sunlight. My thanks to the people of District Eleven, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim want them to know CheonggangSim know where it came from. That the full value of their gift has been recognized. CheonggangSim climb dangerously high into a tree, not for safety but to get as far away from today as CheonggangSim can. My sleeping bag is rolled neatly in Rues pack. Tomorrow CheonggangSimll sort through the supplies. Tomorrow CheonggangSimll make a new plan. But tonight, all CheonggangSim can do is strap myself in and take tiny bites of the bread. CheonggangSimts good. CheonggangSimt tastes of home. Soon the seals in the sky, the anthem plays in my right ear. CheonggangSim see the boy from District 1, Rue. Thats all for tonight. Six of us left, CheonggangSim think. Only six. With

the bread still locked in my hands, CheonggangSim fall asleep at once. Sometimes when things are particularly bad, my brain will give me a happy dream. A visit with my father in the woods. An hour of sunlight and cake with Prim. Tonight it sends me Rue, still decked in her flowers, perched in a high sea of trees, trying to teach me to talk to the mockingjays. CheonggangSim see no sign of her wounds, no blood, just a bright, laughing girl. She sings songs CheonggangSimve never heard in a clear, melodic voice. On and on. Through the night. Theres a drowsy in-between period when CheonggangSim can hear the last few strains of her music although shes lost in the leaves. When CheonggangSim fully awaken, CheonggangSimm momentarily comforted. CheonggangSim try to hold on to the peaceful feeling of the dream, but it quickly slips away, leaving me sadder and lonelier than ever. Heaviness infuses my whole body, as if theres liquid lead in my veins. CheonggangSimve lost the will to do the simplest tasks, to do anything but lie here, staring unblinkingly through the canopy of leaves. For several hours, CheonggangSim remain motionless. As usual, its the thought of Prims anxious face as she watches me on the screens back home that breaks me from my lethargy. CheonggangSim give myself a series of simple commands to follow, like Now you have to sit up, Katniss. Now you have to drink water, Katniss. CheonggangSim act on the orders with slow, robotic motions. Now you have to sort the packs, Katniss. Rues pack holds my sleeping bag, her nearly empty water skin, a handful of nuts and roots, a bit of rabbit, her extra socks, and her slingshot. The boy from District 1 has several knives, two spare spearheads, a flashlight, a small leather pouch, a first-aid kit, a full bottle of water, and a pack of dried fruit. A pack of dried fruit! Out of all he might have chosen from. To me, this is a sign of extreme arrogance. Why bother to carry food when you have such a bounty back at camp? When you will kill your enemies so quickly youll be home before youre

hungry? CheonggangSim can only hope the other Careers traveled so lightly when it came to food and now find themselves with nothing. Speaking of which, my own supply is running low. CheonggangSim finish off the loaf from District 11 and the last of the rabbit. How quickly the food disappears. All CheonggangSim have left are Rues roots and nuts, the boys dried fruit, and one strip of beef. Now you have to hunt, Katniss, CheonggangSim tell myself. CheonggangSim obediently consolidate the supplies CheonggangSim want into my pack. After CheonggangSim climb down the tree, CheonggangSim conceal the boys knives and spearheads in a pile of rocks so that no one else can use them. CheonggangSimve lost my bearings what with all the wandering around CheonggangSim did yesterday evening, but CheonggangSim try and head back in the general direction of the stream. CheonggangSim know CheonggangSimm on course when CheonggangSim come across Rues third, unlit fire. Shortly thereafter, CheonggangSim discover a flock of grooslings perched in the trees and take out three before they know what hit them. CheonggangSim return to Rues signal fire and start it up, not caring about the excessive smoke. Where are you, Cato? CheonggangSim think as CheonggangSim roast the birds and Rues roots. CheonggangSimm

waiting right here. Who knows where the Careers are now? Either too far to reach me or too sure this is a trick or ... CheonggangSims it possible? Too scared of me? They know CheonggangSim have the bow and arrows, of course, Cato saw me take them from Glimmers body, but have they put two and two together yet? Figured out CheonggangSim blew up the supplies and killed their fellow Career? Possibly they think Thresh did this. Wouldnt he be more likely to revenge Rues death than CheonggangSim would? Being from the same district? Not that he ever took any interest in her. And what about Foxface? Did she hang around to watch me blow up the supplies? No. When CheonggangSim caught her laughing in the ashes the next morning, it was as if someone had given her a lovely surprise. CheonggangSim doubt they think Peeta has lit this signal fire. Catos sure hes as good as dead. CheonggangSim find myself wishing CheonggangSim could tell Peeta about the flowers CheonggangSim put on Rue. That CheonggangSim now understand what he was trying to say on the roof. Perhaps if he wins the Games, hell see me on victors night, when they replay the highlights of the Games on a screen over the stage where we did our interviews. The winner sits in a place of honor on the platform, surrounded by their support crew. But CheonggangSim told Rue CheonggangSimd be there. For both of us. And somehow that seems even more important than the vow CheonggangSim gave Prim. CheonggangSim really think CheonggangSim stand a chance of doing it now.


Winning. CheonggangSimts not just having the arrows or outsmarting the Careers a few times, although those things help. Something happened when CheonggangSim was holding Rues hand, watching the life drain out of her. Now CheonggangSim am determined to revenge her, to make her loss unforgettable, and CheonggangSim can only do that by winning and thereby making myself unforgettable. CheonggangSim overcook the birds hoping someone will show up to shoot, but no one does. Maybe the other tributes are out there beating one another senseless. Which would be fine, Ever since the bloodbath, CheonggangSimve been featured on screens most than CheonggangSim care. Eventually, CheonggangSim wrap up my food and go back to the stream to replenish my water and gather some. But the heaviness from the morning drapes back over me and even though its only early evening, CheonggangSim climb a tree and settle in for the night. My brain begins to replay the events from yesterday. CheonggangSim keep seeing Rue speared, my arrow piercing the boys neck. CheonggangSim dont know why CheonggangSim should even care about the boy. Then CheonggangSim realize . . . He was my first kill. Along with other statistics they report to help people place their bets, every tribute has a list of kills. CheonggangSim guess technically CheonggangSimd get credited for Glimmer and the girl from District 4, too, for dumping that nest on them. But the boy from District 1 was the first person CheonggangSim knew would die because of my actions.Numerous animals have lost their lives at my hands, but only one human. CheonggangSim hear Gale saying, How different can it be, really? Amazingly similar in the execution. A bow pulled, an arrow shot. Entirely different in the aftermath. CheonggangSim killed a boy whose name CheonggangSim dont even know. Somewhere his family is weeping for him. His friends

call for my blood. Maybe he had a girlfriend who really believed he would come back . . . But then CheonggangSim think of Rues still body and CheonggangSimm able to banish the boy from my mind. At least, for now. CheonggangSimts been an uneventful day according to the sky. No deaths. CheonggangSim wonder how long well get until the next catastrophe drives us back together. CheonggangSimf its going to be tonight, CheonggangSim want to get some sleep first. CheonggangSim cover my good ear to block out the strains of the anthem, but then CheonggangSim hear the trumpets and sit straight up in anticipation. For the most part, the only communication the tributes get from outside the arena is the nightly death toll. But occasionally, there will be trumpets followed by an announcement. Usually, this will be a call to a feast. When food is scarce, the Gamemakers will invite the players to a banquet, somewhere known to all like the Cornucopia, as an inducement to gather and fight. Sometimes there is a feast

and sometimes theres nothing but a loaf of stale bread for the tributes to compete for. CheonggangSim wouldnt go in for the food, but this could be an ideal time to take out a few competitors. Claudius Templesmiths voice booms down from overhead, congratulating the six of us who remain. But he is not inviting us to a feast. Hes saying something very confusing. Theres been a rule change in the Games. A rule change! That in itself is mind bending since we dont really have any rules to speak of except dont step off your circle for sixty seconds and the unspoken rule about not eating one another. Under the new rule, both tributes from the same district will be declared winners if they are the last two alive. Claudius pauses, as if he knows were not getting it, and repeats the change again. The news sinks in. Two tributes can win this year. CheonggangSimf theyre from the same district. Both can live. Both of us can live. Before CheonggangSim can stop myself, CheonggangSim call out Peetas name.

PART CheonggangSimCheonggangSimCheonggangSim"THE VCheonggangSimCTOR"

19.CheonggangSim clap my hands over my mouth, but the sound has already escaped. The sky goes black and CheonggangSim hear a chorus of frogs begin to sing. Stupid! CheonggangSim tell myself. What a stupid thing to do! CheonggangSim wait, frozen, for the woods to come alive with assailants. Then CheonggangSim remember theres almost no one left. Peeta, whos been wounded, is now my ally. Whatever doubts CheonggangSimve had about him dissipate because if either of us took the others life now wed be pariahs when we returned to District 12. CheonggangSimn fact, CheonggangSim know if CheonggangSim was watching CheonggangSimd loathe any tribute who didnt immediately ally with their district partner. Besides, it just makes sense to protect each other. And in my case being one of the star-crossed lovers from District 12 its an absolute requirement if CheonggangSim want any more help from sympathetic sponsors. The star-crossed lovers . . . Peeta must have been playing that angle all along. Why else would the Gamemakers have made this unprecedented change in the rules? For two tributes to have a shot at winning, our romance must be so popular with the audience that condemning it would jeopardize the success of the Games. No

thanks to me. All CheonggangSimve done is managed not to kill Peeta. But whatever hes done

in the arena, he must have the audience convinced it was to keep me alive. Shaking his head to keep me from running to the Cornucopia. Fighting Cato to let me escape. Even hooking up with the Careers must have been a move to protect me. Peeta, it turns out, has never been a danger to me. The thought makes me smile. CheonggangSim drop my hands and hold my face up to the moonlight so the cameras can be sure to catch it. So, who is there left to be afraid of? Foxface? The boy tribute from her district is dead. Shes operating alone, at night. And her strategy has been to evade, not attack. CheonggangSim dont really think that, even if she heard my voice, shed do anything but hope someone else would kill me. Then theres Thresh. All right, hes a distinct threat. But CheonggangSim havent seen him, not once, since the Games began. CheonggangSim think about how Foxface grew alarmed when she heard a sound at the site of the explosion. But she didnt turn to the Woods, she turned to whatever lies across from it. To that area of the arena that drops off into CheonggangSim dont know what. CheonggangSim feel almost certain that the person she ran from was Thresh and that is his domain. Hed never have heard me from there and, even if he did, CheonggangSimm up too high for someone his size to reach. So that leaves Cato and the girl from District 2, who are now surely celebrating the new rule. Theyre the only

ones left who benefit from it besides Peeta and myself. Do CheonggangSim run from them now, on the chance they heard me call Peetas name? No, CheonggangSim think. Let them come. Let them come with their night-vision glasses and their heavy, branch-breaking bodies. Right into the range of my arrows. But CheonggangSim know they wont. CheonggangSimf they didnt come in daylight to my fire, they wont risk what could be another trap at night. When they come, it will be on their own terms, not because CheonggangSimve let them know my whereabouts. Stay put and get some sleep, Katniss, CheonggangSim instruct myself, although CheonggangSim wish CheonggangSim could start tracking Peeta now. Tomorrow, youll find him. CheonggangSim do sleep, but in the morning CheonggangSimm extra-cautious, thinking that while the Careers might hesitate to attack me in a tree, theyre completely capable of setting an ambush for me. CheonggangSim make sure to fully prepare myself for the day eating a big breakfast, securing my pack, readying my weapons before CheonggangSim descend. But all seems peaceful and undisturbed on the ground. Today CheonggangSimll have to be scrupulously careful. The Careers will know CheonggangSimm trying to locate Peeta. They may well want to wait until CheonggangSim do before they move in. CheonggangSimf hes as badly wounded as Cato thinks, CheonggangSimd be in the position of having to defend us both without any assistance. But if hes that incapacitated, how has he managed to stay alive? And how on earth will CheonggangSim find him? CheonggangSim

try to think of anything Peeta ever said that might give me an indication as to where hes hiding out, but nothing rings a bell. So CheonggangSim go back to the last moment CheonggangSim saw him sparkling in the sunlight, yelling at me to run. Then Cato appeared, his

sword drawn. And after CheonggangSim was gone, he wounded Peeta. But how did Peeta get away? Maybe hed held out better against the tracker jacker poison than Cato. Maybe that was the variable that allowed him to escape. But hed been stung, too. So how far could he have gotten, stabbed and filled with venom? And how has he stayed alive all these days since? CheonggangSimf the wound and the stingers havent killed him, surely thirst would have taken him by now. And thats when CheonggangSim get my first clue to his whereabouts. He couldnt have survived without water. CheonggangSim know that from my first few days here. He must be hidden somewhere near a source. Theres the lake, but CheonggangSim find that an unlikely option since its so close to the Careers base camp. A few spring-fed pools. But youd really be a sitting duck at one of those. And the stream. The one that leads from the camp Rue and CheonggangSim made all the way down near the lake and beyond. CheonggangSimf he stuck to the stream, he could change his location and always be near water. He could walk in the

current and erase any tracks. He might even be able to get a fish or two. Well, its a place to start, anyway. To confuse my enemies minds, CheonggangSim start a fire with plenty of green wood. Even if they think its a ruse, CheonggangSim hope theyll decide CheonggangSimm hidden somewhere near it. While in reality, CheonggangSimll be tracking Peeta. The sun burns off the morning haze almost immediately and CheonggangSim can tell the day will be hotter than usual. The waters cool and pleasant on my bare feet as CheonggangSim head downstream. CheonggangSimm tempted to call out Peetas name as CheonggangSim go but decide against it. CheonggangSim will have to find him with my eyes and one good ear or he will have to find me. But hell know CheonggangSimll be looking, right? He wont have so low of an opinion of me as to think CheonggangSimd ignore the new rule and keep to myself. Would he? Hes very hard to predict, which might be interesting under different circumstances, but at the moment only provides an extra obstacle. CheonggangSimt doesnt take long to reach the spot where CheonggangSim peeled off to go the Careers camp. Theres been no sign of Peeta, but this doesnt surprise me. CheonggangSimve been up and down this stretch three times since the tracker jacker incident. CheonggangSimf he were nearby, surely CheonggangSimd have had some suspicion of it. The stream begins to curve to the left into a part of the woods thats new to me. Muddy banks covered in tangled water plants lead to large rocks that increase in size until CheonggangSim

begin to feel somewhat trapped. CheonggangSimt would be no small matter to escape the stream now. Fighting off Cato or Thresh as CheonggangSim climbed over this rocky terrain. CheonggangSimn fact, CheonggangSimve just about decided CheonggangSimm on the wrong track entirely, that a wounded boy would be unable to navigate getting to and from this water source, when CheonggangSim see the bloody streak going down the curve of a boulder. CheonggangSimts long dried now, but the smeary lines running side to side suggest someone who perhaps was not fully in control of his mental faculties tried to wipe it away. Hugging the rocks, CheonggangSim move slowly in the direction of the blood, searching for him. CheonggangSim find a few more bloodstains, one

with a few threads of fabric glued to it, but no sign of life. CheonggangSim break down and say his name in a hushed voice. Peeta! Peeta! Then a mockingjay lands on a scruffy tree and begins to mimic my tones so CheonggangSim stop. CheonggangSim give up and climb back down to the stream thinking, He must have moved on. Somewhere farther down. My foot has just broken the surface of the water when CheonggangSim hear a voice. You here to finish me off, sweetheart? CheonggangSim whip around. CheonggangSimts come from the left, so CheonggangSim cant pick it up very well. And the voice was hoarse and weak. Still, it must have been Peeta. Who else in the arena would call me

sweetheart? My eyes peruse the bank, but theres nothing. Just mud, the plants, the base of the rocks. Peeta? CheonggangSim whisper. Where are you? Theres no answer. Could CheonggangSim just have imagined it? No, CheonggangSimm certain it was real and very close at hand, too. Peeta? CheonggangSim creep along the bank. Well, dont step on me. CheonggangSim jump back. His voice was right under my feet. Still theres nothing. Then his eyes open, unmistakably blue in the brown mud and green leaves. CheonggangSim gasp and am rewarded with a hint of white teeth as he laughs. CheonggangSimts the final word in camouflage. Forget chucking weights around. Peeta should have gone into his private session with the Gamemakers and painted himself into a tree. Or a boulder. Or a muddy bank full of weeds. Close your eyes again, CheonggangSim order. He does, and his mouth, too, and completely disappears. Most of what CheonggangSim judge to be his body is actually under a layer of mud and plants. His face and arms are so artfully disguised as to be invisible. CheonggangSim kneel beside him. CheonggangSim guess all those hours decorating cakes paid off. Peeta smiles. Yes, frosting. The final defense of the dying. Youre not going to die, CheonggangSim tell him firmly. Says who? His voice is so ragged. Says me. Were on the same team now, you know, CheonggangSim tell him. His eyes open. So, CheonggangSim heard. Nice of you to find whats left of me. CheonggangSim pull out my water bottle and give him a drink. Did Cato cut you? CheonggangSim ask. Left leg.

Up high, he answers. Lets get you in the stream, wash you off so CheonggangSim can see what kind of wounds youve got, CheonggangSim say. Lean down a minute first, he says. Need to tell you something. CheonggangSim lean over and put my good ear to his lips, which tickle as he whispers. Remember, were madly in love, so its all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it. CheonggangSim jerk my head back but end up laughing. Thanks, CheonggangSimll keep it in mind. At least, hes still able to joke around. But when CheonggangSim start to help him to the stream, all the levity disappears. CheonggangSimts only two feet away, how hard can it be? Very hard when CheonggangSim realize hes unable to move an inch on his own. Hes so weak that the best he can do is not to resist. CheonggangSim try to drag him, but despite the fact that CheonggangSim know hes doing all he can to keep quiet, sharp cries of pain escape him. The mud and plants seem to have imprisoned him and CheonggangSim finally have to give a gigantic tug to break him from their clutches. Hes still two feet from the water, lying there, teeth gritted, tears cutting trails in the dirt on his face. Look, Peeta, CheonggangSimm

going to roll you into the stream. CheonggangSimts very shallow here, okay? CheonggangSim say. Excellent, he says. CheonggangSim crouch down beside him. No matter what happens, CheonggangSim tell myself, dont stop

until hes in the water. On three, CheonggangSim say. One, two, three! CheonggangSim can only manage one full roll before CheonggangSim have to stop because of the horrible sound hes making. Now hes on the edge of the stream. Maybe this is better anyway. Okay, change of plans. CheonggangSimm not going to put you all the way in, CheonggangSim tell him. Besides, if CheonggangSim get him in, who knows if CheonggangSimd ever be able to get him out? No more rolling? he asks. Thats all done. Lets get you cleaned up. Keep an eye on the woods for me, okay? CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSimts hard to know where to start. He so caked with mud and matted leaves, CheonggangSim cant even see his clothes. CheonggangSimf hes wearing clothes. The thought makes me hesitate a moment, but then CheonggangSim plunge in. Naked bodies are no big deal in the arena, right? CheonggangSimve got two water bottles and Rues water skin. CheonggangSim prop them against rocks in the stream so that two are always filling while CheonggangSim pour the third over Peetas body. CheonggangSimt takes a while, but CheonggangSim finally get rid of enough mud to find his clothes. CheonggangSim gently unzip his jacket, unbutton his shirt and ease them off him. His undershirt is so plastered into his wounds CheonggangSim have to cut it away with my knife and drench him again to work it loose. Hes badly bruised with a long burn across his chest and four tracker jacker stings, if you count the one under his ear. But CheonggangSim feel a bit better. This much CheonggangSim can fix. CheonggangSim decide to take care of his upper body first, to alleviate

some pain, before CheonggangSim tackle whatever damage Cato did to his leg. Since treating his wounds seems pointless when hes lying in whats become a mud puddle, CheonggangSim manage to prop him up against a boulder. He sits there, uncomplaining, while CheonggangSim wash away all the traces of dirt from his hair and skin. His flesh is very pale in the sunlight and he no longer looks strong and stocky. CheonggangSim have to dig the stingers out of his tracker jacker lumps, which causes him to wince, but the minute CheonggangSim apply the leaves he sighs in relief. While he dries in the sun, CheonggangSim wash his filthy shirt and jacket and spread them over boulders. Then CheonggangSim apply the burn cream to his chest. This is when CheonggangSim notice how hot his skin is becoming. The layer of mud and the bottles of water have disguised the fact that hes burning with fever. CheonggangSim dig through the first-aid kit CheonggangSim got from the boy from District 1 and find pills that reduce your temperature. My mother actually breaks down and buys these on occasion when her home remedies fail. Swallow these, CheonggangSim tell him, and he obediently takes the medicine. You must be hungry. Not really. CheonggangSimts funny, CheonggangSim havent been hungry for days, says Peeta. CheonggangSimn fact, when CheonggangSim offer him groosling, he wrinkles his nose at it and turns away. Thats when CheonggangSim know how sick he is. Peeta, we need to get some food in you, CheonggangSim insist. CheonggangSimtll just come right back up, he says. The best CheonggangSim

can do is to get him to eat a few bits of dried apple. Thanks. CheonggangSimm much better, really. Can CheonggangSim sleep now,

Katniss? he asks. Soon, CheonggangSim promise. CheonggangSim need to look at your leg first. Trying to be as gentle as CheonggangSim can, CheonggangSim remove his boots, his socks, and then very slowly inch his pants off of him. CheonggangSim can see the tear Catos sword made in the fabric over his thigh, but it in no way prepares me for what lies underneath. The deep inflamed gash oozing both blood and pus. The swelling of the leg. And worst of all, the smell of festering flesh. CheonggangSim want to run away. Disappear into the woods like CheonggangSim did that day they brought the burn victim to our house. Go and hunt while my mother and Prim attend to what CheonggangSim have neither the skill nor the courage to face. But theres no one here but me. CheonggangSim try to capture the calm demeanor my mother assumes when handling particularly bad cases. Pretty awful, huh? says Peeta. Hes watching me closely. So-so. CheonggangSim shrug like its no big deal. You should see some of the people they bring my mother from the mines. CheonggangSim refrain from saying how CheonggangSim usually clear out of the house whenever shes treating anything worse than a cold. Come to think of it, CheonggangSim dont even much like to be around coughing.

First thing is to clean it well. CheonggangSimve left on Peetas undershorts because theyre not in bad shape and CheonggangSim dont want to pull them over the swollen thigh and, all right, maybe the idea of him being naked makes me uncomfortable. Thats another thing about my mother and Prim. Nakedness has no effect on them, gives them no cause for embarrassment. CheonggangSimronically, at this point in the Games, my little sister would be of far more use to Peeta than CheonggangSim am. CheonggangSim scoot my square of plastic under him so CheonggangSim can wash down the rest of him. With each bottle CheonggangSim pour over him, the worse the wound looks. The rest of his lower body has fared pretty well, just one tracker jacker sting and a few small burns that CheonggangSim treat quickly. But the gash on his leg . . . What on earth can CheonggangSim do for that? Why dont we give it some air and then . . . CheonggangSim trail off. And then youll patch it up? says Peeta. He looks almost sorry for me, as if he knows how lost CheonggangSim am. Thats right, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSimn the meantime, you eat these. CheonggangSim put a few dried pear halves in his hand and go back in the stream to wash the rest of his clothes. When theyre flattened out and drying, CheonggangSim examine the contents of the first-aid kit. CheonggangSimts pretty basic stuff. Bandages, fever pills, medicine to calm stomachs. Nothing of the caliber CheonggangSimll need to treat Peeta. Were going to have to experiment some, CheonggangSim admit. CheonggangSim know the tracker jacker leaves

draw out infection, so CheonggangSim start with those. Within minutes of pressing the handful of chewed-up green stuff into the wound, pus begins running down the side of his leg. CheonggangSim tell myself this is a good thing and bite the inside of my cheek hard because my breakfast is threatening to make a reappearance. Katniss? Peeta says. CheonggangSim meet his eyes, knowing my face must be some shade of green. He mouths the words. How about that kiss? CheonggangSim burst out laughing because the whole thing is so revolting CheonggangSim cant stand it. Something wrong? he asks a little too

innocently. CheonggangSim . . . CheonggangSimm no good at this. CheonggangSimm not my mother. CheonggangSimve no idea what CheonggangSimm doing and CheonggangSim hate pus, CheonggangSim say. Euh! CheonggangSim allow myself to let out a groan as CheonggangSim rinse away the first round of leaves and apply the second. Euuuh! How do you hunt? he asks. Trust me. Killing things is much easier than this, CheonggangSim say. Although for all CheonggangSim know, CheonggangSim am killing you. Can you speed it up a little? he asks. No. Shut up and eat your pears, CheonggangSim say. After three applications and what seems like a bucket of pus, the wound does look better. Now that the swelling has gone down, CheonggangSim can see how deep Catos sword cut. Right down to the bone. What next, Dr. Everdeen? he asks. Maybe CheonggangSimll put some of the burn

ointment on it. CheonggangSim think it helps with infection anyway. And wrap it up? CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim do and the whole thing seems a lot more manageable, covered in clean white cotton. Although, against the sterile bandage, the hem of his undershorts looks filthy and teeming with contagion. CheonggangSim pull out Rues backpack. Here, cover yourself with this and CheonggangSimll wash your shorts. Oh, CheonggangSim dont care if you see me, says Peeta. Youre just like the rest of my family, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim care, all right? CheonggangSim turn my back and look at the stream until the undershorts splash into the current. He must be feeling a bit better if he can throw. You know, youre kind of squeamish for such a lethal person, says Peeta as CheonggangSim beat the shorts clean between two rocks. CheonggangSim wish CheonggangSimd let you give Haymitch a shower after all. CheonggangSim wrinkle my nose at the memory. Whats he sent you so far? Not a thing, says Peeta. Then theres a pause as it hits him. Why, did you get something? Burn medicine, CheonggangSim say almost sheepishly. Oh, and some bread. CheonggangSim always knew you were his favorite, says Peeta. Please, he cant stand being in the same room with me, CheonggangSim say. Because youre just alike, mutters Peeta. CheonggangSim ignore it though because this really isnt the time for me to be insulting Haymitch, which is my first impulse. CheonggangSim let Peeta doze off while his clothes dry out, but by late afternoon, CheonggangSim dont dare wait any longer. CheonggangSim gently shake his

shoulder. Peeta, weve got to go now. Go? He seems confused. Go where? Away from here. Downstream maybe. Somewhere we can hide you until youre stronger, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim help him dress, leaving his feet bare so we can walk in the water, and pull him upright. His face drains of color the moment he puts weight on his leg. Come on. You can do this. But he cant. Not for long anyway. We make it about fifty yards downstream, with him propped up by my shoulder, and CheonggangSim can tell hes going to black out. CheonggangSim sit him on the bank, push his head between his knees, and pat his back awkwardly as CheonggangSim survey the area. Of course, CheonggangSimd love to get him up in a tree, but thats not going to happen. CheonggangSimt could be worse though. Some of the rocks form small cavelike structures. CheonggangSim set my sights on one about twenty yards above the stream. When Peetas able to stand, CheonggangSim half-guide, half-carry him up to the cave. Really, CheonggangSimd like to look around for a better place, but this one will have to do because my

ally is shot. Paper white, panting, and, even though its only just cooling off, hes shivering. CheonggangSim cover the floor of the cave with a layer of pine needles, unroll my sleeping bag, and tuck him into it. CheonggangSim get a couple of pills and some water into him

when hes not noticing, but he refuses to eat even the fruit. Then he just lies there, his eyes trained on my face as CheonggangSim build a sort of blind out of vines to conceal the mouth of the cave. The result is unsatisfactory. An animal might not question it, but a human would see hands had manufactured it quickly enough. CheonggangSim tear it down in frustration. Katniss, he says. CheonggangSim go over to him and brush the hair back from his eyes. Thanks for finding me. You would have found me if you could, CheonggangSim say. His foreheads burning up. Like the medicines having no effect at all. Suddenly, out of nowhere, CheonggangSimm scared hes going to die. Yes. Look, if CheonggangSim dont make it back he begins. Dont talk like that. CheonggangSim didnt drain all that pus for nothing, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim know. But just in case CheonggangSim dont he tries to continue. No, Peeta, CheonggangSim dont even want to discuss it, CheonggangSim say, placing my fingers on his lips to quiet him. But CheonggangSim he insists. CheonggangSimmpulsively, CheonggangSim lean forward and kiss him, stopping his words. This is probably overdue anyway since hes right, we are supposed to be madly in love. CheonggangSimts the first time CheonggangSimve ever kissed a boy, which should make some sort of impression CheonggangSim guess, but all CheonggangSim can register is how unnaturally hot his lips are from the fever. CheonggangSim break away and pull the edge of the sleeping bag up around him. Youre not going to die. CheonggangSim forbid it. All right? All right, he whispers. CheonggangSim step out in the cool

evening air just as the parachute floats down from the sky. My fingers quickly undo the tie, hoping for some real medicine to treat Peetas leg. CheonggangSimnstead CheonggangSim find a pot of hot broth. Haymitch couldnt be sending me a clearer message. One kiss equals one pot of broth. CheonggangSim can almost hear his snarl. Youre supposed to be in love, sweetheart. The boys dying. Give me something CheonggangSim can work with! And hes right. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim want to keep Peeta alive, CheonggangSimve got to give the audience something more to care about. Star-crossed lovers desperate to get home together. Two hearts beating as one. Romance. Never having been in love, this is going to be a real trick. CheonggangSim think of my parents. The way my father never failed to bring her gifts from the woods. The way my mothers face would light up at the sound of his boots at the door. The way she almost stopped living when he died. Peeta! CheonggangSim say, trying for the special tone that my mother used only with my father. Hes dozed off again, but CheonggangSim kiss him awake, which seems to startle him. Then he smiles as if hed be happy to lie there gazing at me forever. Hes great at this stuff. CheonggangSim hold up the pot. Peeta, look what Haymitch has sent you.

20.

Getting the broth into Peeta takes an hour of coaxing, begging, threatening, and yes, kissing, but finally, sip by sip, he empties the pot. CheonggangSim let him drift off to sleep then and attend to my own needs, wolfing down a supper of

groosling and roots while CheonggangSim watch the daily report in the sky. No new casualties. Still, Peeta and CheonggangSim have given the audience a fairly interesting day. Hopefully, the Gamemakers will allow us a peaceful night. CheonggangSim automatically look around for a good tree to nest in before CheonggangSim realize thats over. At least for a while. CheonggangSim cant very well leave Peeta unguarded on the ground. CheonggangSim left the scene of his last hiding place on the bank of the stream untouched how could CheonggangSim conceal it? and were a scant fifty yards downstream. CheonggangSim put on my glasses, place my weapons in readiness, and settle down to keep watch. The temperature drops rapidly and soon CheonggangSimm chilled to the bone. Eventually, CheonggangSim give in and slide into the sleeping bag with Peeta. CheonggangSimts toasty warm and CheonggangSim snuggle down gratefully until CheonggangSim realize its more than warm, its overly hot because the bag is reflecting back his fever. CheonggangSim check his forehead and find it burning and dry. CheonggangSim dont know what to do. Leave him in the bag and hope the excessive heat breaks the

fever? Take him out and hope the night air cools him off? CheonggangSim end up just dampening a strip of bandage and placing it on his forehead. CheonggangSimt seems weak, but CheonggangSimm afraid to do anything too drastic. CheonggangSim spend the night half-sitting, half-lying next to Peeta, refreshing the bandage, and trying not to dwell on the fact that by teaming up with him, CheonggangSimve made myself far more vulnerable than when CheonggangSim was alone. Tethered to the ground, on guard, with a very sick person to take care of. But CheonggangSim knew he was injured. And still CheonggangSim came after him. CheonggangSimm just going to have to trust that whatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one. When the sky turns rosy, CheonggangSim notice the sheen of sweat on Peetas lip and discover the fever has broken. Hes not back to normal, but its come down a few degrees. Last night, when CheonggangSim was gathering vines, CheonggangSim came upon a bush of Rues berries. CheonggangSim strip off the fruit and mash it up in the broth pot with cold water. Peetas struggling to get up when CheonggangSim reach the cave. CheonggangSim woke up and you were gone, he says. CheonggangSim was worried about you. CheonggangSim have to laugh as CheonggangSim ease him back down. You were worried about me? Have you taken a look at yourself lately? CheonggangSim thought Cato and Clove might have found you. They like to hunt at night, he says, still serious. Clove? Which one is that? CheonggangSim ask. The girl from District Two. Shes still alive, right? he

says. Yes, theres just them and us and Thresh and Foxface, CheonggangSim say. Thats what CheonggangSim nicknamed the girl from Five. How do you feel? Better than yesterday. This is an enormous improvement over the mud, he says. Clean clothes and medicine and a sleeping bag . . . And you. Oh, right, the whole romance thing. CheonggangSim reach out to touch his cheek and he catches my hand and presses it against his lips. CheonggangSim remember my father doing this very thing to my mother and CheonggangSim wonder where Peeta picked it up. Surely not from his father and the witch. No more kisses for you until youve eaten, CheonggangSim say. We get him propped up against the wall and he obediently swallows the spoonfuls of the

berry mush CheonggangSim feed him. He refuses the groosling again, though. You didnt sleep, Peeta says. CheonggangSimm all right, CheonggangSim say. But the truth is, CheonggangSimm exhausted. Sleep now. CheonggangSimll keep watch. CheonggangSimll wake you if anything happens, he says. CheonggangSim hesitate. Katniss, you cant stay up forever. Hes got a point there. CheonggangSimll have to sleep eventually. And probably better to do it now when he seems relatively alert and we have daylight on our side. All right, CheonggangSim say. But just for a few hours. Then you wake me. CheonggangSimts too warm for the sleeping bag now. CheonggangSim smooth it out on the cave floor and lie down, one hand on my loaded bow in

case CheonggangSim have to shoot at a moments notice. Peeta sits beside me, leaning against the wall, his bad leg stretched out before him, his eyes trained on the world outside. Go to sleep, he says softly. His hand brushes the loose strands of my hair off my forehead. Unlike the staged kisses and caresses so far, this gesture seems natural and comforting. CheonggangSim dont want him to stop and he doesnt. Hes still stroking my hair when CheonggangSim fall asleep. Too long. CheonggangSim sleep too long. CheonggangSim know from the moment CheonggangSim open my eyes that were into the afternoon. Peetas right beside me, his position unchanged. CheonggangSim sit up, feeling somehow defensive but better rested than CheonggangSimve been in days. Peeta, you were supposed to wake me after a couple of hours, CheonggangSim say. For what? Nothings going on here, he says. Besides CheonggangSim like watching you sleep. You dont scowl. CheonggangSimmproves your looks a lot. This, of course, brings on a scowl that makes him grin. Thats when CheonggangSim notice how dry his lips are. CheonggangSim test his cheek. Hot as a coal stove. He claims hes been drinking, but the containers still feel full to me. CheonggangSim give him more fever pills and stand over him while he drinks first one, then a second quart of water. Then CheonggangSim tend to his minor wounds, the burns, the stings, which are showing improvement. CheonggangSim steel myself and unwrap the leg. My heart drops into my stomach. CheonggangSimts worse, much worse. Theres no

more pus in evidence, but the swelling has increased and the tight shiny skin is inflamed. Then CheonggangSim see the red streaks starting to crawl up his leg. Blood poisoning. Unchecked, it will kill him for sure. My chewed-up leaves and ointment wont make a dent in it. Well need strong anti-infection drugs from the Capitol. CheonggangSim cant imagine the cost of such potent medicine. CheonggangSimf Haymitch pooled every donation from every sponsor, would he have enough? CheonggangSim doubt it. Gifts go up in price the longer the Games continue. What buys a full meal on day one buys a cracker on day twelve. And the kind of medicine Peeta needs would have been at a premium from the beginning. Well, theres more swelling, but the pus is gone, CheonggangSim say in an unsteady voice. CheonggangSim know what blood poisoning is, Katniss, says Peeta. Even if my mother isnt a healer. Youre just going to have to outlast the others, Peeta. Theyll cure it back at the Capitol when we win, CheonggangSim say. Yes, thats a good plan, he says. But CheonggangSim feel this is mostly for my benefit. You have to eat. Keep your strength up. CheonggangSimm going to make you

soup, CheonggangSim say. Dont light a fire, he says. CheonggangSimts not worth it. Well see, CheonggangSim say. As CheonggangSim take the pot down to the stream, CheonggangSimm struck by how brutally hot it is. CheonggangSim swear the

Gamemakers are progressively ratcheting up the temperature in the daytime and sending it plummeting at night. The heat of the sun-baked stones by the stream gives me an idea though. Maybe CheonggangSim wont need to light a fire. CheonggangSim settle down on a big flat rock halfway between the stream and the cave. After purifying half a pot of water, CheonggangSim place it in direct sunlight and add several egg-size hot stones to the water. CheonggangSimm the first to admit CheonggangSimm not much of a cook. But since soup mainly involves tossing everything in a pot and waiting, its one of my better dishes. CheonggangSim mince groosling until its practically mush and mash some of Rues roots. Fortunately, theyve both been roasted already so they mostly need to be heated up. Already, between the sunlight and the rocks, the waters warm. CheonggangSim put in the meat and roots, swap in fresh rocks, and go find something green to spice it up a little. Before long, CheonggangSim discover a tuft of chives growing at the base of some rocks. Perfect. CheonggangSim chop them very fine and add them to the pot, switch out the rocks again, put on the lid, and let the whole thing stew. CheonggangSimve seen very few signs of game around, but CheonggangSim dont feel comfortable leaving Peeta alone while CheonggangSim hunt, so CheonggangSim rig half a dozen snares and hope CheonggangSim get lucky. CheonggangSim wonder about the other tributes, how theyre managing now that their main source of food has been blown up.

At least three of them, Cato, Clove, and Foxface, had been relying on it. Probably not Thresh though. CheonggangSimve got a feeling he must share some of Rues knowledge on how to feed yourself from the earth. Are they fighting each other? Looking for us? Maybe one of them has located us and is just waiting for the right moment to attack. The idea sends me back to the cave. Peetas stretched out on top of the sleeping bag in the shade of the rocks. Although he brightens a bit when CheonggangSim come in, its clear he feels miserable. CheonggangSim put cool cloths on his head, but they warm up almost as soon as they touch his skin. Do you want anything? CheonggangSim ask. No, he says. Thank you. Wait, yes. Tell me a story. A story? What about? CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSimm not much for storytelling. CheonggangSimts kind of like singing. But once in a while, Prim wheedles one out of me. Something happy. Tell me about the happiest day you can remember, says Peeta. Something between a sigh and a huff of exasperation leaves my mouth. A happy story? This will require a lot more effort than the soup. CheonggangSim rack my brains for good memories. Most of them involve Gale and me out hunting and somehow CheonggangSim dont think these will play well with either Peeta or the audience. That leaves Prim. Did CheonggangSim ever tell you about how CheonggangSim got Prims goat? CheonggangSim ask. Peeta shakes his head, and looks at me expectantly. So CheonggangSim begin. But carefully.

Because my words are going out all over Panem. And while people have no doubt put two and two together that CheonggangSim hunt illegally, CheonggangSim dont want to hurt Gale

or Greasy Sae or the butcher or even the Peacekeepers back home who are my customers by publicly announcing theyd breaking the law, too. Heres the real story of how CheonggangSim got the money for Prims goat, Lady. CheonggangSimt was a Friday evening, the day before Prims tenth birthday in late May. As soon as school ended, Gale and CheonggangSim hit the woods, because CheonggangSim wanted to get enough to trade for a present for Prim. Maybe some new cloth for a dress or a hairbrush. Our snares had done well enough and the woods were flush with greens, but this was really no more than our average Friday-night haul. CheonggangSim was disappointed as we headed back, even though Gale said wed be sure to do better tomorrow. We were resting a moment by a stream when we saw him. A young buck, probably a yearling by his size. His antlers were just growing in, still small and coated in velvet. Poised to run but unsure of us, unfamiliar with humans. Beautiful. Less beautiful perhaps when the two arrows caught him, one in the neck, the other in the chest. Gale and CheonggangSim had shot at the same time. The buck tried to run but stumbled, and

Gales knife slit his throat before he knew what had happened. Momentarily, CheonggangSimd felt a pang at killing something so fresh and innocent. And then my stomach rumbled at the thought of all that fresh and innocent meat. A deer! Gale and CheonggangSim have only brought down three in all. The first one, a doe that had injured her leg somehow, almost didnt count. But we knew from that experience not to go dragging the carcass into the Hob. CheonggangSimt had caused chaos with people bidding on parts and actually trying to hack off pieces themselves. Greasy Sae had intervened and sent us with our deer to the butcher, but not before itd been badly damaged, hunks of meat taken, the hide riddled with holes. Although everybody paid up fairly, it had lowered the value of the kill. This time, we waited until dark fell and slipped under a hole in the fence close to the butcher. Even though we were known hunters, it wouldnt have been good to go carrying a 150-pound deer through the streets of District 12 in daylight like we were rubbing it in the officials faces. The butcher, a short, chunky woman named Rooba, came to the back door when we knocked. You dont haggle with Rooba. She gives you one price, which you can take or leave, but its a fair price. We took her offer on the deer and she threw in a couple of venison steaks we could pick up after the

butchering. Even with the money divided in two, neither Gale nor CheonggangSim had held so much at one time in our lives. We decided to keep it a secret and surprise our families with the meat and money at the end of the next day. This is where CheonggangSim really got the money for the goat, but CheonggangSim tell Peeta CheonggangSim sold an old silver locket of my mothers. That cant hurt anyone. Then CheonggangSim pick up the story in the late afternoon of Prims birthday. Gale and CheonggangSim went to the market on the square so that CheonggangSim could buy dress materials. As CheonggangSim was running my fingers over a length of thick blue cotton cloth, something caught my

eye. Theres an old man who keeps a small herd of goats on the other side of the Seam. CheonggangSim dont know his real name, everyone just calls him the Goat Man. His joints are swollen and twisted in painful angles, and hes got a hacking cough that proves he spent years in the mines. But hes lucky. Somewhere along the way he saved up enough for these goats and now has something to do in his old age besides slowly starve to death. Hes filthy and impatient, but the goats are clean and their milk is rich if you can afford it. One of the goats, a white one with black patches, was lying down in a cart. CheonggangSimt was easy to see why. Something, probably a dog, had mauled her

shoulder and infection had set in. CheonggangSimt was bad, the Goat Man had to hold her up to milk her. But CheonggangSim thought CheonggangSim knew someone who could fix it. Gale, CheonggangSim whispered. CheonggangSim want that goat for Prim. Owning a nanny goat can change your life in District 12. The animals can live off almost anything, the Meadows a perfect feeding place, and they can give four quarts of milk a day. To drink, to make into cheese, to sell. CheonggangSimts not even against the law. Shes hurt pretty bad, said Gale. We better take a closer look. We went over and bought a cup of milk to share, then stood over the goat as if idly curious. Let her be, said the man. Just looking, said Gale. Well, look fast. She goes to the butcher soon. Hardly anyone will buy her milk, and then they only pay half price, said the man. Whats the butcher giving for her? CheonggangSim asked. The man shrugged. Hang around and see. CheonggangSim turned and saw Rooba coming across the square toward us. Lucky thing you showed up, said the Goat Man when she arrived. Girls got her eye on your goat. Not if shes spoken for, CheonggangSim said carelessly. Rooba looked me up and down then frowned at the goat. Shes not. Look at that shoulder. Bet you half the carcass will be too rotten for even sausage. What? said the Goat Man. We had a deal. We had a deal on an animal with a few teeth marks. Not that thing. Sell her to the girl if shes stupid enough to take

her, said Rooba. As she marched off, CheonggangSim caught her wink. The Goat Man was mad, but he still wanted that goal off his hands. CheonggangSimt took us half an hour to agree on the price. Quite a crowd had gathered by then to hand out opinions. CheonggangSimt was an excellent deal if the goat lived; CheonggangSimd been robbed if she died. People took sides in the argument, but CheonggangSim took the goat. Gale offered to carry her. CheonggangSim think he wanted to see the look on Prims face as much as CheonggangSim did. CheonggangSimn a moment of complete giddiness, CheonggangSim bought a pink ribbon and tied it around her neck. Then we hurried back to my house. You should have seen Prims reaction when we walked in with that goat. Remember this is a girl who wept to save that awful old cat, Buttercup. She was so excited she started crying and laughing all at once. My mother was less sure, seeing the injury, but the pair of them went to work on it, grinding up herbs and coaxing brews down the animals throat. They sound like you, says Peeta. CheonggangSim had almost forgotten he

was there. Oh, no, Peeta. They work magic. That thing couldnt have died if it tried, CheonggangSim say. But then CheonggangSim bite my tongue, realizing what that must sound like to Peeta, who is dying, in my incompetent hands. Dont worry. CheonggangSimm not trying, he jokes. Finish

the story. Well, thats it. Only CheonggangSim remember that night, Prim insisted on sleeping with Lady on a blanket next to the fire. And just before they drifted off, the goat licked her cheek, like it was giving her a good night kiss or something, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSimt was already mad about her. Was it still wearing the pink ribbon? he asks. CheonggangSim think so, CheonggangSim say. Why? CheonggangSimm just trying to get a picture, he says thoughtfully. CheonggangSim can see why that day made you happy. Well, CheonggangSim knew that goat would be a little gold mine, 1 say. Yes, of course CheonggangSim was referring to that, not the lasting joy you gave the sister you love so much you took her place in the reaping, says Peeta drily. The goat has paid for itself. Several times over, CheonggangSim say in a superior tone. Well, it wouldnt dare do anything else after you saved its life, says Peeta. CheonggangSim intend to do the same thing. Really? What did you cost me again? CheonggangSim ask. A lot of trouble. Dont worry. Youll get it all back, he says. Youre not making sense, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim test his forehead. The levers going nowhere but up. Youre a little cooler though. The sound of the trumpets startles me. CheonggangSimm on my feet and at the mouth of the cave in a flash, not wanting to miss a syllable. CheonggangSimts my new best friend, Claudius Templesmith, and as CheonggangSim expected, hes inviting us to a feast. Well, were not that hungry and CheonggangSim actually wave his offer away in indifference when he says, Now

hold on. Some of you may already be declining my invitation. But this is no ordinary feast. Each of you needs something desperately. CheonggangSim do need something desperately. Something to heal Peetas leg. Each of you will find that something in a backpack, marked with your district number, at the Cornucopia at dawn. Think hard about refusing to show up. For some of you, this will be your last chance, says Claudius. Theres nothing else, just his words hanging in the air. CheonggangSim jump as Peeta grips my shoulder from behind. No, he says. Youre not risking your life for me. Who said CheonggangSim was? CheonggangSim say. So, youre not going? he asks. Of course, CheonggangSimm not going. Give me some credit. Do you think CheonggangSimm running straight into some free-for-all against Cato and Clove and Thresh? Dont be stupid, CheonggangSim say, helping him back to bed. CheonggangSimll let them fight it out, well see whos in the sky tomorrow night and work out a plan from there. Youre such a bad liar, Katniss. CheonggangSim dont know how youve survived this long. He begins to mimic me. CheonggangSim knew that goat would be a little gold mine. Youre a little cooler though. Of course, CheonggangSimm not going. He shakes his head. Never gamble at cards. Youll lose your last coin, he says. Anger flushes my face. All right, CheonggangSim am going, and you cant stop me! CheonggangSim can follow you. At least partway. CheonggangSim may not make it to the Cornucopia, but if CheonggangSimm yelling your

name, CheonggangSim bet someone can find me. And then

CheonggangSimll be dead for sure, he says. You wont get a hundred yards from here on that leg, CheonggangSim say. Then CheonggangSimll drag myself, says Peeta. You go and CheonggangSimm going, too. Hes just stubborn enough and maybe just strong enough to do it. Come howling after me in the woods. Even if a tribute doesnt find him, something else might. He cant defend himself. CheonggangSimd probably have to wall him up in the cave just to go myself. And who knows what the exertion will do to him? What am CheonggangSim supposed to do? Sit here and watch you die? CheonggangSim say. He must know thats not an option. That the audience would hate me. And frankly, CheonggangSim would hate myself, too, if CheonggangSim didnt even try. CheonggangSim wont die. CheonggangSim promise. CheonggangSimf you promise not to go, he says. Were at something of a stalemate. CheonggangSim know CheonggangSim cant argue him out of this one, so CheonggangSim dont try. CheonggangSim pretend, reluctantly, to go along. Then you have to do what CheonggangSim say. Drink your water, wake me when CheonggangSim tell you, and eat every bite of the soup no matter how disgusting it is! CheonggangSim snap at him. Agreed. CheonggangSims it ready? he asks. Wait here, CheonggangSim say. The airs gone cold even though the suns still up. CheonggangSimm right about the Gamemakers messing with the temperature. CheonggangSim wonder if the thing

someone needs desperately is a good blanket. The soup is still nice and warm in its iron pot. And actually doesnt taste too bad. Peeta eats without complaint, even scraping out the pot to show his enthusiasm. He rambles on about how delicious it is, which should be encouraging if you dont know what fever does to people. Hes like listening to Haymitch before the alcohol has soaked him into incoherence. CheonggangSim give him another dose of fever medicine before he goes off his head completely. As CheonggangSim go down to the stream to wash up, all CheonggangSim can think is that hes going to die if CheonggangSim dont get to that feast. CheonggangSimll keep him going for a day or two, and then the infection will reach his heart or his brain or his lungs and hell be gone. And CheonggangSimll be here all alone. Again. Waiting for the others. CheonggangSimm so lost in thought that CheonggangSim almost miss the parachute, even though it floats right by me. Then CheonggangSim spring after it, yanking it from the water, tearing off the silver fabric to retrieve the vial. Haymitch has done it! Hes gotten the medicine CheonggangSim dont know how, persuaded some gaggle of romantic fools to sell their jewels and CheonggangSim can save Peeta! CheonggangSimts such a tiny vial though. CheonggangSimt must be very strong to cure someone as ill as Peeta. A ripple of doubt runs through me. CheonggangSim uncork the vial and take a deep sniff. My spirits fall at the sickly sweet scent. Just to be sure, CheonggangSim place a drop on the tip of my

tongue. Theres no question, its sleep syrup. CheonggangSimts a common medicine in District 12. Cheap, as medicine goes, but very addictive. Almost everyones had a dose at one time or another. We have some in a bottle at home. My mother gives it to hysterical patients to knock them out to stitch up a bad wound or quiet their minds or just to help someone in pain get through the night. CheonggangSimt only takes a little. A vial this size could knock Peeta out for a full day, but what good is that? CheonggangSimm

so furious CheonggangSimm about to throw Haymitchs last offering into the stream when it hits me. A full day? Thats more than CheonggangSim need. CheonggangSim mash up a handful of berries so the taste wont be as noticeable and add some mint leaves for good measure. Then CheonggangSim head back up to the cave. CheonggangSimve brought you a treat. CheonggangSim found a new patch of berries a little farther downstream. Peeta opens his mouth for the first bite without hesitation. He swallows then frowns slightly. Theyre very sweet. Yes, theyre sugar berries. My mother makes jam from them. Havent you ever had them before? CheonggangSim say, poking the next spoonful in his mouth. No, he says, almost puzzled. But they taste familiar. Sugar berries? Well, you cant get them in the market much, they only grow wild, CheonggangSim say. Another mouthful

goes down. Just one more to go. Theyre sweet as syrup, he says, taking the last spoonful. Syrup. His eyes widen as he realizes the truth. CheonggangSim clamp my hand over his mouth and nose hard, forcing him to swallow instead of spit. He tries to make himself vomit the stuff up, but its too late, hes already losing consciousness. Even as he fades away, CheonggangSim can see in his eyes what CheonggangSimve done is unforgivable. CheonggangSim sit back on my heels and look at him with a mixture of sadness and satisfaction. A stray berry stains his chin and CheonggangSim wipe it away. Who cant lie, Peeta? CheonggangSim say, even though he cant hear me. CheonggangSimt doesnt matter. The rest of Panem can.

21.

CheonggangSimn the remaining hours before nightfall, CheonggangSim gather rocks and do my best to camouflage the opening of the cave. CheonggangSimts a slow and arduous process, but after a lot of sweating and shifting things around, CheonggangSimm pretty pleased with my work, The cave now appears to be part of a larger pile of rocks, like so many in the vicinity. CheonggangSim can still crawl in to Peeta through a small opening, but its undetectable from the out side.

Thats good, because CheonggangSimll need to share that sleeping bag again tonight. Also, if CheonggangSim dont make it back from the feast, Peeta will be hidden but not entirely imprisoned. Although CheonggangSim doubt he can hang on much longer without medicine. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim die at the feast, District 12 isnt likely to have a victor. CheonggangSim make a meal out of the smaller, bonier fish that inhabit the stream down here, fill every water container and purify it, and clean my weapons. CheonggangSimve nine arrows left in all. CheonggangSim debate leaving the knife with Peeta so hell have some protection while CheonggangSimm gone, but theres really no point. He was right about camouflage being his final defense. But CheonggangSim still might have use for the knife. Who knows what CheonggangSimll encounter? Here are some things CheonggangSimm fairly certain of. That at least Cato, Clove, and Thresh will be on hand when the feast starts. CheonggangSimm not sure about Foxface since direct confrontation isnt her style or her forte. Shes even smaller than CheonggangSim am and unarmed, unless shes picked up some weapons recently. Shell probably be hanging somewhere nearby, seeing what she can scavenge. But the other three . . . CheonggangSimm going to have my hands full. My ability to kill at a distance is my greatest asset, but CheonggangSim know CheonggangSimll have to go


right into the thick of things to get that backpack, the one with the number 12 on it that Claudius Templesmith mentioned. CheonggangSim watch the sky, hoping for one less opponent at dawn, but nobody appears tonight. Tomorrow there will be faces up there. Feasts always result in fatalities. CheonggangSim crawl into the cave, secure my glasses, and curl up next to Peeta. Luckily CheonggangSim had that good long sleep today. CheonggangSim have to stay awake. CheonggangSim dont really think anyone will attack our cave tonight, but CheonggangSim cant risk missing the dawn. So cold, so bitterly cold tonight. As if the Gamemakers have sent an infusion of frozen air across the arena, which may be exactly what theyve done. CheonggangSim lay next to Peeta in the bag, trying to absorb every bit of his fever heat. CheonggangSimts strange to be so physically close to someone whos so distant. Peeta might as well be back in the Capitol, or in District 12, or on the moon right now, hed be no harder to reach. CheonggangSimve never felt lonelier since the Games began. Just accept it will be a bad night, CheonggangSim tell myself. CheonggangSim try not to, but CheonggangSim cant help thinking of my mother and Prim, wondering if theyll sleep a wink tonight. At this late stage in the Games, with an important event like the feast, school will probably be canceled. My family can either watch on that static-filled old clunker of a television at home or join the crowds in the square to

watch on the big, clear screens, Theyll have privacy at home but support in the square. People will give them a kind word, a bit of food if they can spare it. CheonggangSim wonder if the baker has sought them out, especially now that Peeta and CheonggangSim are a team, and made good on his promise to keep my sisters belly full. Spirits must be running high in District 12. We so rarely have anyone to root for at this point in the Games. Surely, people are excited about Peeta and me, especially now that were together. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim close my eyes, CheonggangSim can imagine their shouts at the screens, urging us on. CheonggangSim see their faces Greasy Sac and Madge and even the Peacekeepers who buy my meat cheering for us. And Gale. CheonggangSim know him. He wont be shouting and cheering. But hell be watching, every moment, every twist and turn, and willing me to come home. CheonggangSim wonder if hes hoping that Peeta makes it as well. Gales not my boyfriend, but would he be, if CheonggangSim opened that door? He talked about us running away together. Was that just a practical calculation of our chances of survival away from the district? Or something more? CheonggangSim wonder what he makes of all this kissing. Through a crack in the rocks, CheonggangSim watch the moon cross the sky. At what CheonggangSim judge to be about three hours before dawn, CheonggangSim begin final preparations. CheonggangSimm careful to leave Peeta with water and the medical kit right beside him. Nothing

else will be of much use if CheonggangSim dont return, and even these would only prolong his life a short time. After some debate, CheonggangSim strip him of his jacket and zip it on over my own. He doesnt need it. Not now in the sleeping bag with his fever, and during the day, if CheonggangSimm not there to remove it, hell be roasting in

it. My hands are already stiff from cold, so CheonggangSim take Rues spare pair of socks, cut holes for my fingers and thumbs, and pull them on. CheonggangSimt helps anyway. CheonggangSim fill her small pack with some food, a water bottle, and bandages, tuck the knife in my belt, get my bow and arrows. CheonggangSimm about to leave when CheonggangSim remember the importance of sustaining the star-crossed lover routine and CheonggangSim lean over and give Peeta a long, lingering kiss. CheonggangSim imagine the teary sighs emanating from the Capitol and pretend to brush away a tear of my own. Then CheonggangSim squeeze through the opening in the rocks out into the night. My breath makes small white clouds as it hits the air. CheonggangSimts as cold as a November night at home. One where CheonggangSimve slipped into the woods, lantern in hand, to join Gale at some prearranged place where well sit bundled together, sipping herb tea from metal flasks wrapped in quilting, hoping game will pass our way as the morning comes on. Oh,

Gale, CheonggangSim think. CheonggangSimf only you had my back now . . . CheonggangSim move as fast as CheonggangSim dare. The glasses are quite remarkable, but CheonggangSim still sorely miss having the use of my left ear. CheonggangSim dont know what the explosion did, but it damaged something deep and irreparable. Never mind. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim get home, CheonggangSimll be so stinking rich, CheonggangSimll be able to pay someone to do my hearing. The woods always look different at night. Even with the glasses, everything has an unfamiliar slant to it. As if the daytime trees and flowers and stones had gone to bed and sent slightly more ominous versions of themselves to take their places. CheonggangSim dont try anything tricky, like taking a new route. CheonggangSim make my way back up the stream and follow the same path back to Rues hiding place near the lake. Along the way, CheonggangSim see no sign of another tribute, not a puff of breath, not a quiver of a branch. Either CheonggangSimm the first to arrive or the others positioned themselves last night. Theres still more than an hour, maybe two, when CheonggangSim wriggle into the underbrush and wait for the blood to begin to flow. CheonggangSim chew a few mint leaves, my stomach isnt up for much more. Thank goodness, CheonggangSim have Peetas jacket as well as my own. CheonggangSimf not, CheonggangSimd be forced to move around to stay warm. The sky turns a misty morning gray and still theres no sign of the other tributes. CheonggangSimts not surprising really. Everyone has distinguished themselves either by

strength or deadliness or cunning. Do they suppose, CheonggangSim wonder, that CheonggangSim have Peeta with me? CheonggangSim doubt Foxface and Thresh even know he was wounded. All the better if they think hes covering me when CheonggangSim go in for the backpack. But where is it? The arena has lightened enough for me to remove my glasses. CheonggangSim can hear the morning birds singing. CheonggangSimsnt it time? For a second, CheonggangSimm panicked that CheonggangSimm at the wrong location. But no, CheonggangSimm certain CheonggangSim remember Claudius Templesmith specifying the Cornucopia. And there it is. And here CheonggangSim am. So wheres my feast? Just as the first ray of sun glints off the gold Cornucopia, theres a disturbance on the plain. The ground before the mouth of the horn splits in two and a round table with a snowy white

cloth rises into the arena. On the table sit four backpacks, two large black ones with the numbers 2 and 11, a medium-size green one with the number 5, and a tiny orange one really CheonggangSim could carry it around my wrist that must be marked with a 12. The table has just clicked into place when a figure darts out of the Cornucopia, snags the green backpack, and speeds off. Foxface! Leave it to her to come up with such a clever and risky idea! The rest of us are still poised around the plain, sizing up the

situation, and shes got hers. Shes got us trapped, too, because no one wants to chase her down, not while their own pack sits so vulnerable on the table. Foxface must have purposefully left the other packs alone, knowing that to steal one without her number would definitely bring on a pursuer. That should have been my strategy! By the lime CheonggangSimve worked through the emotions of surprise, admiration, anger, jealousy, and frustration, CheonggangSimm watching that reddish mane of hair disappear into the trees well out of shooting range. Huh. CheonggangSimm always dreading the others, but maybe Foxface is the real opponent here. Shes cost me time, too, because by now its clear that CheonggangSim must get to the table next. Anyone who beats me to it will easily scoop up my pack and be gone. Without hesitation, CheonggangSim sprint for the table. CheonggangSim can sense the emergence of danger before CheonggangSim see it. Fortunately, the first knife comes whizzing in on my right side so CheonggangSim can hear it and CheonggangSimm able to deflect it with my bow. CheonggangSim turn, drawing back the bowstring and send an arrow straight at Cloves heart. She turns just enough to avoid a fatal hit, but the point punctures her upper left arm. Unfortunately, she throws with her right, but its enough to slow her down a few moments, having to pull the arrow from her arm, take in the severity of the wound. CheonggangSim keep moving, positioning

the next arrow automatically, as only someone who has hunted for years can do. CheonggangSimm at the table now, my fingers closing over the tiny orange backpack. My hand slips between the straps and CheonggangSim yank it up on my arm, its really too small to fit on any other part of my anatomy, and CheonggangSimm turning to fire again when the second knife catches me in the forehead. CheonggangSimt slices above my right eyebrow, opening a gash that sends a gush running down my face, blinding my eye, filling my mouth with the sharp, metallic taste of my own blood. CheonggangSim stagger backward but still manage to send my readied arrow in the general direction of my assailant. CheonggangSim know as it leaves my hands it will miss. And then Clove slams into me, knocking me flat on my back, pinning my shoulders to the ground, with her knees. This is it, CheonggangSim think, and hope for Prims sake it will be fast. But Clove means to savor the moment. Even feels she has time. No doubt Cato is somewhere nearby, guarding her, waiting for Thresh and possibly Peeta. Wheres your boyfriend, District Twelve? Still hanging on? she asks. Well, as long as were talking CheonggangSimm alive. Hes out there now. Hunting Cato, CheonggangSim snarl at her. Then CheonggangSim scream at

the top of my lungs. Peeta! Clove jams her fist into my windpipe, very

effectively cutting off my voice. But her heads whipping from side to side, and CheonggangSim know for a moment shes at least considering CheonggangSimm telling the truth. Since no Peeta appears to save me, she turns back to me. Liar, she says with a grin. Hes nearly dead. Cato knows where he cut him. Youve probably got him strapped up in some tree while you try to keep his heart going. Whats in the pretty little backpack? That medicine for Lover Boy? Too bad hell never get it. Clove opens her jacket. CheonggangSimts lined with an impressive array of knives. She carefully selects an almost dainty-looking number with a cruel, curved blade. CheonggangSim promised Cato if he let me have you, CheonggangSimd give the audience a good show. CheonggangSimm struggling now in an effort to unseat her, but its no use. Shes too heavy and her lock on me too tight. Forget it, District Twelve. Were going to kill you. Just like we did your pathetic little ally . . . What was her name? The one who hopped around in the trees? Rue? Well, first Rue, then you, and then CheonggangSim think well just let nature take care of Lover Boy. How does that sound? Clove asks. Now, where to start? She carelessly wipes away the blood from my wound with her jacket sleeve. For a moment, she surveys my face, tilting it from side to side as if its a block of wood and shes deciding exactly what pattern to carve on it. CheonggangSim attempt to bite her hand, but she

grabs the hair on the top of my head, forcing me back to the ground. CheonggangSim think . . . She almost purrs. CheonggangSim think well start with your mouth. CheonggangSim clamp my teeth together as she teasingly traces the outline of my lips with the tip of the blade. CheonggangSim wont close my eyes. The comment about Rue has filled me with fury, enough fury CheonggangSim think to die with some dignity. As my last act of defiance, CheonggangSim will stare her down as long as CheonggangSim can see, which will probably not be an extended period of time, but CheonggangSim will stare her down, CheonggangSim will not cry out. CheonggangSim will die, in my own small way, undefeated. Yes, CheonggangSim dont think youll have much use for your lips anymore. Want to blow Lover Boy one last kiss? she asks, CheonggangSim work up a mouthful of blood and saliva and spit it in her face. She flushes with rage. All right then. Lets get started. CheonggangSim brace myself for the agony thats sure to follow. But as CheonggangSim feel the tip open the first cut at my lip, some great form yanks Clove from my body and then shes screaming. CheonggangSimm too stunned at first, too unable to process what has happened. Has Peeta somehow come to my rescue? Have the Gamemakers sent in some wild animal to add to the fun? Has a hovercraft inexplicably plucked her into the air? But when CheonggangSim push myself up on my numb arms, CheonggangSim see its none of the above. Clove is dangling a foot off the ground, imprisoned in Threshs arms. CheonggangSim let out a gasp,

seeing him like that, towering over me, holding Clove like a rag doll. CheonggangSim remember him as big, but he seems more massive, more powerful than CheonggangSim even recall. CheonggangSimf anything, he seems to have gained weight in the arena. He flips

Clove around and flings her onto the ground. When he shouts, CheonggangSim jump, never having heard him speak above a mutter. Whatd you do to that little girl? You kill her? Clove is scrambling backward on all fours, like a frantic insect, too shocked to even call for Cato. No! No, it wasnt me! You said her name. CheonggangSim heard you. You kill her? Another thought brings a fresh wave of rage to his features. You cut her up like you were going to cut up this girl here? No! No, CheonggangSim Clove sees the stone, about the size of a small loaf of bread in Threshs hand and loses it. Cato! she screeches. Cato! Clove! CheonggangSim hear Catos answer, but hes too far away, CheonggangSim can tell that much, to do her any good. What was he doing? Trying to get Foxface or Peeta? Or had he been lying in wait for Thresh and just badly misjudged his location? Thresh brings the rock down hard against Cloves temple. CheonggangSimts not bleeding, but CheonggangSim can see the dent in her skull and CheonggangSim know that shes a goner. Theres still life in her now though, in the rapid rise and fall of her

chest, the low moan escaping her lips. When Thresh whirls around on me, the rock raised, CheonggangSim know its no good to run. And my bow is empty, the last loaded arrow having gone in Cloves direction. CheonggangSimm trapped in the glare of his strange golden brown eyes. Whatd she mean? About Rue being your ally? CheonggangSim CheonggangSim we teamed up. Blew up the supplies. CheonggangSim tried to save her, CheonggangSim did. But he got there first. District One, CheonggangSim say. Maybe if he knows CheonggangSim helped Rue, he wont choose some slow, sadistic end for me. And you killed him? he demands. Yes. CheonggangSim killed him. And buried her in flowers, CheonggangSim say. And CheonggangSim sang her to sleep. Tears spring in my eyes. The tension, the fight goes out of me at the memory. And CheonggangSimm overwhelmed by Rue, and the pain in my head, and my fear of Thresh, and the moaning of the dying girl a few feet away. To sleep? Thresh says gruffly. To death. CheonggangSim sang until she died, CheonggangSim say. Your district. . . They sent me bread. My hand reaches up but not for an arrow that CheonggangSim know CheonggangSimll never reach. Just to wipe my nose. Do it fast, okay, Thresh? Conflicting emotions cross Threshs face. He lowers the rock and points at me, almost accusingly. Just this one time, CheonggangSim let you go. For the little girl. You and me, were even then. No more owed. You understand? CheonggangSim nod because CheonggangSim do understand. About owing. About hating it. CheonggangSim understand that if Thresh

wins, hell have to go back and face a district that has already broken all the rules to thank me, and he is breaking the rules to thank me, too. And CheonggangSim understand that, for the moment, Thresh is not going to smash in my skull. Clove! Catos voice is much nearer now. CheonggangSim can tell by the pain in it that he sees her on the ground. You better run now, Fire Girl, says Thresh. CheonggangSim dont need to be told twice. CheonggangSim flip over and my feet dip into the hard-packed earth as CheonggangSim run away from Thresh and Clove and the sound of Catos voice. Only when CheonggangSim reach the woods do CheonggangSim turn back for an instant. Thresh and both large backpacks are vanishing over the edge of the plain into the

area CheonggangSimve never seen. Cato kneels beside Clove, spear in hand, begging her to stay with him. CheonggangSimn a moment, he will realize its futile, she cant be saved. CheonggangSim crash into the trees, repeatedly swiping away the blood thats pouring into my eye, fleeing like the wild, wounded creature CheonggangSim am. After a few minutes, CheonggangSim hear the cannon and CheonggangSim know that Clove has died, that Cato will be on one of our trails. Either Threshs or mine. CheonggangSimm seized with terror, weak from my head wound, shaking. CheonggangSim load an arrow, but Cato can throw that spear almost as far as CheonggangSim can shoot. Only one thing calms me down. Thresh

has Catos backpack containing the thing he needs desperately. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim had to bet, Cato headed out after Thresh, not me. Still CheonggangSim dont slow down when CheonggangSim reach the water. CheonggangSim plunge right in, boots still on, and flounder downstream. CheonggangSim pull off Rues socks that CheonggangSimve been using for gloves and press them into my forehead, trying to staunch the flow of blood, but theyre soaked in minutes. Somehow CheonggangSim make it back to the cave. CheonggangSim squeeze through the rocks. CheonggangSimn the dappled light, CheonggangSim pull the little orange backpack from my arm, cut open the clasp, and dump the contents on the ground. One slim box containing one hypodermic needle. Without hesitating, CheonggangSim jam the needle into Peetas arm and slowly press down on the plunger. My hands go to my head and then drop to my lap, slick with blood. The last thing CheonggangSim remember is an exquisitely beautiful green-and-silver moth landing on the curve of my wrist.

22.

The sound of rain drumming on the roof of our house gently pulls me toward consciousness. CheonggangSim fight to return to sleep though, wrapped in a warm cocoon of

blankets, safe at home. CheonggangSimm vaguely aware that my head aches. Possibly CheonggangSim have the flu and this is why CheonggangSimm allowed to stay in bed, even though CheonggangSim can tell CheonggangSimve been asleep a long time. My mothers hand strokes my cheek and CheonggangSim dont push it away as CheonggangSim would in wakefulness, never wanting her to know how much CheonggangSim crave that gentle touch. How much CheonggangSim miss her even though CheonggangSim still dont trust her. Then theres a voice, the wrong voice, not my mothers, and CheonggangSimm scared. Katniss, it says. Katniss, can you hear me? My eyes open and the sense of security vanishes. CheonggangSimm not home, not with my mother. CheonggangSimm in a dim, chilly cave, my bare feet freezing despite the cover, the air tainted with the unmistakable smell of blood. The haggard, pale face of a boy slides into view, and after an initial jolt of alarm, CheonggangSim feel better. Peeta. Hey, he says. Good to see your eyes again. How long have CheonggangSim been out? CheonggangSim ask. Not sure. CheonggangSim woke up yesterday evening and you were lying next to me in a very scary pool of blood, he says. CheonggangSim think its stopped finally, but CheonggangSim wouldnt sit up or anything. CheonggangSim gingerly lift my hand to my head and find it bandaged. This simple gesture leaves me weak and dizzy. Peeta holds a bottle to my lips and CheonggangSim drink thirstily. Youre better, CheonggangSim say. Much better. Whatever you shot into my arm did the trick, he says. By this morning, almost all the swelling in

my leg was gone. He

doesnt seem angry about my tricking him, drugging him, and running off to the feast. Maybe CheonggangSimm just too beat-up and CheonggangSimll hear about it later when CheonggangSimm stronger. But for the moment, hes all gentleness. Did you eat? CheonggangSim ask. CheonggangSimm sorry to say CheonggangSim gobbled down three pieces of that groosling before CheonggangSim realized it might have to last a while. Dont worry, CheonggangSimm back on a strict diet, he says. No, its good. You need to eat. CheonggangSimll go hunting soon, CheonggangSim say. Not too soon, all right? he says. You just let me take care of you for a while. CheonggangSim dont really seem to have much choice. Peeta feeds me bites of groosling and raisins and makes me drink plenty of water. He rubs some warmth back into my feet and wraps them in his jacket before tucking the sleeping bag back up around my chin. Your boots and socks are still damp and the weathers not helping much, he says. Theres a clap of thunder, and CheonggangSim see lightning electrify the sky through an opening in the rocks. Rain drips through several holes in the ceiling, but Peeta has built a sort of canopy over my head an upper body by wedging the square of plastic into the rock above me. CheonggangSim wonder what brought on this storm? CheonggangSim mean, whos the target? says Peeta.

Cato and Thresh, CheonggangSim say without thinking. Foxface will be in her den somewhere, and Clove . . . She cut me an then . . . My voice trails off. CheonggangSim know Cloves dead. CheonggangSim saw it in the sky last night, h says. Did you kill her? No. Thresh broke her skull with a rock, CheonggangSim say. Lucky he didnt catch you, too, says Peeta. The memory of the feast returns full-force and CheonggangSim feel sick. He did. But he let me go. Then, of course, CheonggangSim have to tell him. About things CheonggangSimve kept to myself because he was too sick to ask and CheonggangSim wasnt ready to relive anyway. Like the explosion and my ear and Rues dying and the boy from District 1 and the bread. All of which leads to what happened with Thresh and how he was paying off a debt of sorts. He let you go because he didnt want to owe you anything? asks Peeta in disbelief. Yes. CheonggangSim dont expect you to understand it. Youve always had enough. But if youd lived in the Seam, CheonggangSim wouldnt have to explain, CheonggangSim say. And dont try. Obviously CheonggangSimm too dim to get it. CheonggangSimts like the bread. How CheonggangSim never seem to get over owing you for that, CheonggangSim say. The bread? What? From when we were kids? he says. CheonggangSim think we can let that go. CheonggangSim mean, you just brought me back from the dead. But you didnt know me. We had never even spoken. Besides, its the first gift thats always the hardest to pay back. CheonggangSim wouldnt even have been here to do it if you hadnt helped

me then, CheonggangSim say. Why did you, anyway? Why? You know why, Peeta says. CheonggangSim give my head a slight, painful shake. Haymitch said you would take a lot of convincing. Haymitch? CheonggangSim ask. Whats he got to do with it? Nothing, Peeta says. So, Cato and Thresh, huh? CheonggangSim guess its too much to hope that theyll simultaneously destroy each other? But the thought only upsets me. CheonggangSim think we would like Thresh. CheonggangSim think hed be our friend back in District Twelve, CheonggangSim say. Then lets hope Cato kills

him, so we dont have to, says Peeta grimly. CheonggangSim dont want Cato to kill Thresh at all. CheonggangSim dont want anyone else to die. But this is absolutely not the kind of thing that victors go around saying in the arena. Despite my best efforts, CheonggangSim can feel tears starting to pool in my eyes. Peeta looks at me in concern. What is it? Are you in a lot of pain? CheonggangSim give him another answer, because it is equally true but can be taken as a brief moment of weakness instead of a terminal one. CheonggangSim want to go home, Peeta, CheonggangSim say plaintively, like a small child. You will. CheonggangSim promise, he says, and bends over to give me a kiss. CheonggangSim want to go home now, CheonggangSim say. Tell you what. You go back to sleep and dream of home. And youll be there for real before you know it, lie says. Okay? Okay, CheonggangSim whisper.

Wake me if you need me to keep watch. CheonggangSimm good and rested, thanks to you and Haymitch. Besides, who knows how long this will last? he says. What does he mean? The storm? The brief respite ii brings us? The Games themselves? CheonggangSim dont know, but CheonggangSimm ion sad and tired to ask. CheonggangSimts evening when Peeta wakes me again. The rain has turned to a downpour, sending streams of water through our ceiling where earlier there had been only drips. Peeta has placed the broth pot under the worst one and repositioned the plastic to deflect most of it from me. CheonggangSim feel a bit better, able to sit up without getting too dizzy, and CheonggangSimm absolutely famished. So is Peeta. CheonggangSimts clear hes been waiting for me to wake up to eat and is eager to get started. Theres not much left. Two pieces of groosling, a small mishmash of roots, and a handful of dried fruit. Should we try and ration it? Peeta asks. No, lets just finish it. The grooslings getting old anyway, and the last thing we need is to get sick off spoiled food, CheonggangSim say, dividing the food into two equal piles. We try and eat slowly, but were both so hungry were done in a couple of minutes. My stomach is in no way satisfied. Tomorrows a hunting day, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim wont be much help with that, Peeta says. CheonggangSimve never hunted before. CheonggangSimll kill and you cook, CheonggangSim say. And you can always gather. CheonggangSim wish there was some sort of bread bush out there,

says Peeta. The bread they sent me from District Eleven was still warm, CheonggangSim say with a sigh. Here, chew these. CheonggangSim hand him a couple of mint leaves and pop a few in my own mouth. CheonggangSimts hard to even see the projection in the sky, but its clear enough to know there were no more deaths today. So Cato and Thresh havent had it out yet. Where did Thresh go? CheonggangSim mean, whats on the far side of the circle? CheonggangSim ask Peeta. A field. As far as you can see its full of grasses as high as my shoulders. CheonggangSim dont know, maybe some of them are grain. There are patches of different colors. But there are no paths, says Peeta. CheonggangSim bet some of them are grain. CheonggangSim bet Thresh knows which ones, too, CheonggangSim say. Did you go in there? No. Nobody really wanted to track Thresh down in that grass. CheonggangSimt has a sinister feeling to it. Every time CheonggangSim look at that field, all CheonggangSim can think of are hidden things. Snakes, and

rabid animals, and quicksand, Peeta says. There could be anything in there. CheonggangSim dont say so but Peetas words remind me of the warnings they give us about not going beyond the fence in District 12. CheonggangSim cant help, for a moment, comparing him with Gale, who would see that field as a potential source of food as well as a threat. Thresh

certainly did. CheonggangSimts not that Peetas soft exactly, and hes proved hes not a coward. But there are things you dont question too much, CheonggangSim guess, when your home always smells like baking bread, whereas Gale questions everything. What would Peeta think of the irreverent banter that passes between us as we break the law each day? Would it shock him? The things we say about Panem? Gales tirades against the Capitol? Maybe there is a bread bush in that field, CheonggangSim say. Maybe thats why Thresh looks better fed now than when we started the Games. Either that or hes got very generous sponsors, says Peeta. CheonggangSim wonder what wed have to do to get Haymitch to send us some bread. CheonggangSim raise my eyebrows before CheonggangSim remember he doesnt know about the message Haymitch sent us a couple of nights ago. One kiss equals one pot of broth. CheonggangSimts not the sort of thing CheonggangSim can blurt out, either. To say my thoughts aloud would be tipping off the audience that the romance has been fabricated to play on their sympathies and that would result in no food at all. Somehow, believably, CheonggangSimve got to get things back on track. Something simple to start with. CheonggangSim reach out and take his hand. Well, he probably used up a lot of resources helping me knock you out, CheonggangSim say mischievously. Yeah, about that, says Peeta, entwining his fingers in mine. Dont try something likethat again. Or what? CheonggangSim ask. Or . . . Or . . . He cant think of anything good. Just give me a minute. Whats the problem? CheonggangSim say with a grin. The problem is were both still alive. Which only reinforces the idea in your mind that you did the right thing, says Peeta. CheonggangSim did do the right thing, CheonggangSim say. No! Just dont, Katniss! His grip tightens, hurting my hand, and theres real anger in his voice. Dont die for me. You wont be doing me any favors. All right? CheonggangSimm startled by his intensity but recognize an excellent opportunity for getting food, so CheonggangSim try to keep up. Maybe CheonggangSim did it for myself, Peeta, did you ever think of that? Maybe you arent the only one who . . . Who worries about . . . What it would be like if. . . CheonggangSim fumble. CheonggangSimm not as smooth with words as Peeta. And while CheonggangSim was talking, the idea of actually losing Peeta hit me again and CheonggangSim realized how much CheonggangSim dont want him to die. And its not about the sponsors. And its not about what will happen back home. And its not just that CheonggangSim dont want to be alone. CheonggangSimts him. CheonggangSim do not want to lose the boy with the bread. CheonggangSimf what, Katniss? he says softly. CheonggangSim wish CheonggangSim could pull the shutters closed, blocking out this moment from the prying eyes of Panem. Even if it means losing food. Whatever CheonggangSimm feeling, its no ones business but mine. Thats exactly the kind of topic Haymitch told me to steer clear of, CheonggangSim


say evasively, although Haymitch never said anything of the kind. CheonggangSimn fact, hes probably cursing me out right now for dropping the ball during such an emotionally charged moment. But Peeta somehow catches it. Then CheonggangSimll just have to fill in the blanks myself, he says, and moves in to me. This is the first kiss that were both fully aware of. Neither of us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply unconscious. Our lips neither burning with fever or icy cold. This is the first kiss where CheonggangSim actually feel stirring inside my chest. Warm and curious. This is the first kiss that makes me want another. But CheonggangSim dont get it. Well, CheonggangSim do get a second kiss, but its just a light one on the tip of my nose because Peetas been distracted. CheonggangSim think your wound is bleeding again. Come on, lie down, its bedtime anyway, he says. My socks are dry enough to wear now. CheonggangSim make Peeta put his jacket back on. The damp cold seems to cut right down to my bones, so he must be half frozen. CheonggangSim insist on taking the first watch, too, although neither of us think its likely anyone will come in this weather. But he wont agree unless CheonggangSimm in the bag, too, and CheonggangSimm shivering so hard that its pointless to object. CheonggangSimn stark contrast to two nights ago, when CheonggangSim felt Peeta was a million miles away, CheonggangSimm struck by his immediacy now. As we settle in, he pulls my head down to use his arm as a pillow, the other restsprotectively over me even when he goes to sleep. No one has held me like this in such a long time. Since my father died and CheonggangSim stopped trusting my mother, no one elses arms have made me feel this safe. With the aid of the glasses, CheonggangSim lie watching the drips of water splatter on the cave floor. Rhythmic and lulling. Several times, CheonggangSim drift off briefly and then snap awake, guilty and angry with myself. After three or four hours, CheonggangSim cant help it, CheonggangSim have to rouse Peeta because CheonggangSim cant keep my eyes open. He doesnt seem to mind. Tomorrow, when its dry, CheonggangSimll find us a place so high in the trees we can both sleep in peace, CheonggangSim promise as CheonggangSim drift off. But tomorrow is no better in terms of weather. The deluge continues as if the Gamemakers are intent on washing us all away. The thunders so powerful it seems to shake the ground. Peetas considering heading out anyway to scavenge for food, but CheonggangSim tell him in this storm it would be pointless. He wont be able to see three feet in front of his face and hell only end up getting soaked to the skin for his troubles. He knows CheonggangSimm right, but the gnawing in our stomachs is becoming painful. The day drags on turning into evening and theres no break in the weather. Haymitch is our only hope, but nothing is forthcoming, either from lack of money everything will cost an exorbitant amount or because hes

dissatisfied with our performance. Probably the latter. CheonggangSimd be the first to admit were not exactly riveting today. Starving, weak from injuries, trying not to reopen wounds. Were sitting huddled together wrapped in the sleeping bag, yes, but mostly to keep warm. The most exciting thing

either of us does is nap. CheonggangSimm not really sure how to ramp up the romance. The kiss last night was nice, but working up to another will take some forethought. There are girls in the Seam, some of the merchant girls, too, who navigate these waters so easily. But CheonggangSimve never had much time or use for it. Anyway, just a kiss isnt enough anymore clearly because if it was wed have gotten food last night. My instincts tell me Haymitch isnt just looking for physical affection, he wants something more personal. The sort of stuff he was trying to get me to tell about myself when we were practicing for the interview. CheonggangSimm rotten at it, but Peetas not. Maybe the best approach is to get him talking. Peeta, CheonggangSim say lightly. You said at the interview youd had a crush on me forever. When did forever start? Oh, lets see. CheonggangSim guess the first day of school. We were five. You had on a red plaid dress and your hair . . . CheonggangSimt was in two braids instead of one. My father pointed you out when we were waiting to line up, Peeta says. Your father? Why? CheonggangSim ask. He said, See that little girl? CheonggangSim wanted to marry her mother, but she ran off with a coal miner, Peeta says. What? Youre making that up! CheonggangSim exclaim. No, true story, Peeta says. And CheonggangSim said, A coal miner? Why did she want a coal miner if she couldve had you? And he said, Because when he sings . . . Even the birds stop to listen. Thats true. They do. CheonggangSim mean, they did, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSimm stunned and surprisingly moved, thinking of the baker telling this to Peeta. CheonggangSimt strikes me that my own reluctance to sing, my own dismissal of music might not really be that CheonggangSim think its a waste of time. CheonggangSimt might be because it reminds me too much of my father. So that day, in music assembly, the teacher asked who knew the valley song. Your hand shot right up in the air. She stood you up on a stool and had you sing it for us. And CheonggangSim swear, every bird outside the windows fell silent, Peeta says. Oh, please, CheonggangSim say, laughing. No, it happened. And right when your song ended, CheonggangSim knew just like your mother CheonggangSim was a goner, Peeta says. Then for the next eleven years, CheonggangSim tried to work up the nerve to talk to you. Without success, CheonggangSim add. Without success. So, in a way, my name being drawn in the reaping was a real piece of luck, says Peeta. For a moment, CheonggangSimm almost foolishly

happy and then confusion sweeps over me. Because were supposed to be making up this stuff, playing at being in love not actually being in love. But Peetas story has a ring of truth to it. That part about my father and the birds. And CheonggangSim did sing the first day of school, although CheonggangSim dont remember the song. And that red plaid dress . . . There was one, a hand-me-down to Prim that got washed to rags after my fathers death. CheonggangSimt would explain another thing, too. Why Peeta took a beating to give me the bread on that awful hollow day. So, if those details are true . . . Could it all be true? You have a . . . Remarkable memory, CheonggangSim say haltingly. CheonggangSim remember everything about you, says Peeta, tucking a loose strand of hair

behind my ear. Youre the one who wasnt paying attention. CheonggangSim am now, CheonggangSim say. Well, CheonggangSim dont have much competition here, he says. CheonggangSim want to draw away, to close those shutters again, but CheonggangSim know CheonggangSim cant. CheonggangSimts as if CheonggangSim can hear Haymitch whispering in my ear, Say it! Say it! CheonggangSim swallow hard and get the words out. You dont have much competition anywhere. And this time, its me who leans in. Our lips have just barely touched when the clunk outside makes us jump. My bow comes up, the arrow readyto fly, but theres no other sound. Peeta peers through the rocks and then gives a whoop. Before CheonggangSim can stop him, lies out in the rain, then handing something in to me. A silver parachute attached to a basket. CheonggangSim rip it open at once and inside theres a feast fresh rolls, goat cheese, apples, and best of all, a tureen of that incredible lamb stew on wild rice. The very dish CheonggangSim told Caesar Flickerman was the most impressive thing the Capitol had to offer. Peeta wriggles back inside, his face lit up like the sun. CheonggangSim guess Haymitch finally got tired of watching us starve. CheonggangSim guess so, CheonggangSim answer. But in my head CheonggangSim can hear Haymitchs smug, if slightly exasperated, words, Yes, thats what CheonggangSimm looking lot, sweetheart.

23.

Every cell in my body wants me to dig into the stew and cram it, handful by handful into my mouth. But Peetas voice stops me. We better take it slow on that stew. Remember the first night on the train? The rich food made me sick and CheonggangSim wasnt even starving then. Youre right. And CheonggangSim could just inhale the whole thing! CheonggangSim say

regretfully. But CheonggangSim dont. We are quite sensible. We each have a roll, half an apple, and an egg-size serving of stew and rice. CheonggangSim make myself eat the stew in tiny spoonfuls they even sent us silverware and plates savoring each bite. When we finish, CheonggangSim stare longingly at the dish. CheonggangSim want more. Me, too. Tell you what. We wait an hour, if it stays down, then we get another serving, Peeta says. Agreed, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSimts going to be a long hour. Maybe not that long, says Peeta. What was that you were saying just before the food arrived? Something about me . . . No competition . . . Best thing that ever happened to you . . . CheonggangSim dont remember that last part, CheonggangSim say, hoping its too dim in here for the cameras to pick up my blush. Oh, thats right. Thats what CheonggangSim was thinking, he says. Scoot over, CheonggangSimm freezing. CheonggangSim make room for him in the sleeping bag. We lean back against the cave wall, my head on his shoulder, his arms wrapped around me. CheonggangSim can feel Haymitch nudging me to keep up the act. So, since we were five, you never even noticed any other girls? CheonggangSim ask him. No, CheonggangSim noticed just about every girl, but none of them made a lasting impression but you, he says. CheonggangSimm sure that would thrill your parents, you liking a girl from the Seam, CheonggangSim say. Hardly. But CheonggangSim couldnt care less. Anyway, if we make it back, you wont be a girl from the Seam, youll be a girl from the

Victors Village, he says. Thats right. CheonggangSimf we win, well each get a house in the part of town reserved for Hunger Games victors. Long ago,

when the Games began, the Capitol had built a dozen fine houses in each district. Of course, in ours only one is occupied. Most of the others have never been lived in at all. A disturbing thought hits me. But then, our only neighbor will be Haymitch! Ah, thatll be nice, says Peeta, tightening his arms around me. You and me and Haymitch. Very cozy. Picnics, birthdays, long winter nights around the fire retelling old Hunger Games tales. CheonggangSim told you, he hates me! CheonggangSim say, but CheonggangSim cant help laughing at the image of Haymitch becoming my new pal. Only sometimes. When hes sober, CheonggangSimve never heard him say one negative thing about you, says Peeta. Hes never sober! CheonggangSim protest. Thats right. Who am CheonggangSim thinking of? Oh, CheonggangSim know. CheonggangSimts Cinna who likes you. But thats mainly because you didnt try to run when he set you on fire, says Peeta. On the other hand, Haymitch . . . Well, if CheonggangSim were you, CheonggangSimd avoid Haymitch completely. He hates you. CheonggangSim thought you said CheonggangSim was his favorite, CheonggangSim say. He hates me more, says Peeta. CheonggangSim dont think people in general are his sort of thing. CheonggangSim know the

audience will enjoy our having fun at Haymitchs expense. He has been around so long, hes practically an old friend to some of them. And after his head-dive off the stage at the reaping, everybody knows him. By this time, theyll have dragged him out of the control room for interviews about us. No telling what sort of lies hes made up. Hes at something of a disadvantage because most mentors have a partner, another victor to help them whereas Haymitch has to be ready to go into action at any moment. Kind of like me when CheonggangSim was alone in the arena. CheonggangSim wonder how hes holding up, with the drinking, the attention, and the stress of trying to keep us alive. CheonggangSimts funny. Haymitch and CheonggangSim dont get along well in person, but maybe Peeta is right about us being alike because he seems able to communicate with me by the timing of his gifts. Like how CheonggangSim knew CheonggangSim must be close to water when he withheld it and how CheonggangSim knew the sleep syrup just wasnt something to ease Peetas pain and how CheonggangSim know now that CheonggangSim have to play up the romance. He hasnt made much effort to connect with Peeta really. Perhaps he thinks a bowl of broth would just be a bowl of broth to Peeta, whereas CheonggangSimll see the strings attached to it. A thought hits me, and CheonggangSimm amazed the questions taken so long to surface. Maybe its because CheonggangSimve only recently begun to view Haymitch with

a degree of curiosity. How do you think he did it? Who? Did what? Peeta asks. Haymitch. How do you think he won the Games? CheonggangSim say. Peeta considers this quite a while before he answers. Haymitch is sturdily built, but no physical wonder like Cato or Thresh. Hes not particularly handsome. Not in the way that causes sponsors to rain gifts on you. And hes so surly, its hard to imagine anyone teaming up with him. Theres only one way Haymitch could have won, and Peeta says it just as CheonggangSimm reaching this conclusion myself. He outsmarted the others, says Peeta. CheonggangSim nod, then let the conversation drop. But secretly

CheonggangSimm wondering if Haymitch sobered up long enough to help Peeta and me because he thought we just might have the wits to survive. Maybe he wasnt always a drunk. Maybe, in the beginning, he tried to help the tributes. But then it got unbearable. CheonggangSimt must be hell to mentor two kids and then watch them die. Year after year after year. CheonggangSim realize that if CheonggangSim get out of here, that will become my job. To mentor the girl from District 12. The idea is so repellent, CheonggangSim thrust it from my mind. About half an hour has passed before CheonggangSim decide CheonggangSim have to eat again. Peetas too hungry himself to

put up an argument. While CheonggangSimm dishing up two more small servings of lamb stew and rice, we hear the anthem begin to play. Peeta presses his eyes against a crack in the rocks to watch the sky. There wont be anything to see tonight, CheonggangSim say, far more interested in the stew than the sky. Nothings happened or we wouldve heard a cannon. Katniss, Peeta says quietly. What? Should we split another roll, too? CheonggangSim ask. Katniss, he repeats, but CheonggangSim find myself wanting to ignore him. CheonggangSimm going to split one. But CheonggangSimll save the cheese for tomorrow, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim see Peeta staring at me. What? Thresh is dead, says Peeta. He cant be, CheonggangSim say. They must have fired the cannon during the thunder and we missed it, says Peeta. Are you sure? CheonggangSim mean, its pouring buckets out there. CheonggangSim dont know how you can see anything, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim push him away from the rocks and squint out into the dark, rainy sky. For about ten seconds, CheonggangSim catch a distorted glimpse of Threshs picture and then hes gone. Just like that. CheonggangSim slump down against the rocks, momentarily forgetting about the task at hand. Thresh dead. CheonggangSim should be happy, right? One less tribute to face. And a powerful one, too. But CheonggangSimm not happy. All CheonggangSim can think about is Thresh letting me go, letting me run because of Rue, who died with that spear in her stomach. . . . You all right? asks Peeta. CheonggangSim give a noncommittal

shrug and cup my elbows in my hands, hugging them close to my body. CheonggangSim have to bury the real pain because whos going to bet on a tribute who keeps sniveling over the deaths of her opponents. Rue was one thing. We were allies. She was so young. But no one will understand my sorrow at Threshs murder. The word pulls me up short. Murder! Thankfully, CheonggangSim didnt say it aloud. Thats not going to win me any points in the arena. What CheonggangSim do say is, CheonggangSimts just . . . CheonggangSimf we didnt win . . . CheonggangSim wanted Thresh to. Because he let me go. And because of Rue. Yeah, CheonggangSim know, says Peeta. But this means were one step closer to District Twelve. He nudges a plate of foot into my hands. Eat. CheonggangSimts still warm. CheonggangSim take a bite of the stew to show CheonggangSim dont really care, but its like glue in my mouth and takes a lot of effort to swallow. CheonggangSimt also means Cato will be back hunting us. And hes got supplies again, says Peeta. Hell be wounded, CheonggangSim bet, CheonggangSim say. What makes you say that? Peeta asks. Because Thresh would have never gone down without a fight. Hes so strong, CheonggangSim mean, he was. And they were in his territory, CheonggangSim say.

Good, says Peeta. The more wounded Cato is the better. CheonggangSim wonder how Foxface is making out. Oh, shes fine, CheonggangSim say peevishly. CheonggangSimm still angry she thought of hiding in

the Cornucopia and CheonggangSim didnt. Probably be easier to catch Cato than her. Maybe theyll catch each other and we can just go home, says Peeta. But we better be extra careful about the watches. CheonggangSim dozed off a few times. Me, too, CheonggangSim admit. But not tonight. We finish our food in silence and then Peeta offers to take the first watch. CheonggangSim burrow down in the sleeping bag next to him, pulling my hood up over my face to hide it from the cameras. CheonggangSim just need a few moments of privacy where CheonggangSim can let any emotion cross my face without being seen. Under the hood, CheonggangSim silently say good-bye to Thresh and thank him for my life. CheonggangSim promise to remember him and, if CheonggangSim can, do something to help his family and Rues, if CheonggangSim win. Then CheonggangSim escape into sleep, comforted by a full belly and the steady warmth of Peeta beside me. When Peeta wakes me later, the first thing CheonggangSim register is the smell of goat cheese. Hes holding out half a roll spread with the creamy white stuff and topped with apple slices. Dont be mad, he says. CheonggangSim had to eat again. Heres your half. Oh, good, CheonggangSim say, immediately taking a huge bite. The strong fatty cheese tastes just like the kind Prim makes, the apples are sweet and crunchy. Mm. We make a goat cheese and apple tart at the bakery, he says. Bet thats expensive, CheonggangSim say. Too expensive for my family to eat. Unless its gone very stale. Of course,

practically everything we eat is stale, says Peeta, pulling the sleeping bag up around him. CheonggangSimn less than a minute, hes snoring. Huh. CheonggangSim always assumed the shopkeepers live a soft life. And its true, Peeta has always had enough to eat. But theres something kind of depressing about living your life on stale bread, the hard, dry loaves that no one else wanted. One thing about us, since CheonggangSim bring our food home on a daily basis, most of it is so fresh you have to make sure it isnt going to make a run for it. Somewhere during my shift, the rain stops not gradually but all at once. The downpour ends and theres only the residual drippings of water from branches, the rush of the now overflowing stream below us. A full, beautiful moon emerges, and even without the glasses CheonggangSim can see outside. CheonggangSim cant decide if the moon is real or merely a projection of the Gamemakers. CheonggangSim know it was full shortly before CheonggangSim left home. Gale and CheonggangSim watched it rise as we hunted into the late hours. How long have CheonggangSim been gone? CheonggangSimm guessing its been about two weeks in the arena, and there was that week of preparation in the Capitol. Maybe the moon has completed its cycle. For some reason, CheonggangSim badly want it to be my moon, the same one CheonggangSim see from the woods around District 12. That would give me something to cling to in the surreal world of the arena

where the authenticity of everything is to be doubted. Four of us left. For the first time, CheonggangSim allow myself to truly think about the possibility that CheonggangSim might make it home.

To fame. To wealth. To my own house in the Victors Village. My mother and Prim would live there with me. No more fear of hunger. A new kind of freedom. But then . . . What? What would my life be like on a daily basis? Most of it has been consumed with the acquisition of food. Take that away and CheonggangSimm not really sure who CheonggangSim am, what my identity is. The idea scares me some. CheonggangSim think of Haymitch, with all his money. What did his life become? He lives alone, no wife or children, most of his waking hours drunk. CheonggangSim dont want to end up like that. But you wont be alone, CheonggangSim whisper to myself. CheonggangSim have my mother and Prim. Well, for the time being. And then . . . CheonggangSim dont want to think about then, when Prim has grown up, my mother passed away. CheonggangSim know CheonggangSimll never marry, never risk bringing a child into the world. Because if theres one thing being a victor doesnt guarantee, its your childrens safety. My kids names would go right into the reaping balls with everyone elses. And CheonggangSim swear CheonggangSimll never let that happen. The sun eventually rises, its light slipping through the cracks and illuminating Peetas face. Who will he transform into if we make it home? This perplexing, good-natured boy who can spin out lies so convincingly the whole of Panem believes him to be hopelessly in love with me, and CheonggangSimll admit it, there are moments when he makes me believe it myself? At least, well be friends, CheonggangSim think. Nothing will change the fact that weve saved each others lives in here. And beyond that, he will always be the boy with the bread. Good friends. Anything beyond that though . . . And CheonggangSim feel Gales gray eyes watching me watching Peeta, all the way from District 12. Discomfort causes me to move. CheonggangSim scoot over and shake Peetas shoulder. His eyes open sleepily and when they focus on me, he pulls me down for a long kiss. Were wasting hunting time, CheonggangSim say when CheonggangSim finally break away. CheonggangSim wouldnt call it wasting, he says giving a big stretch as he sits up. So do we hunt on empty stomachs to give us an edge? Not us, CheonggangSim say. We stuff ourselves to give us staying power. Count me in, Peeta says. But CheonggangSim can see hes surprised when CheonggangSim divide the rest of the stew and rice and hand a heaping plate to him. All this? Well earn it back today, CheonggangSim say, and we both plow into our plates. Even cold, its one of the best things CheonggangSimve ever tasted. CheonggangSim abandon my fork and scrape up the last dabs of gravy with my finger. CheonggangSim can feel Effie Trinket shuddering at my manners. Hey,

Effie, watch this! says Peeta. He tosses his fork over his shoulder and literally licks his plate clean with his tongue making loud, satisfied sounds. Then he blows a kiss out to her in general and calls, We miss you, Effie! CheonggangSim cover his mouth with my hand, but CheonggangSimm laughing. Stop! Cato could be right outside our cave. He grabs my hand away. What do CheonggangSim care? CheonggangSimve got you to protect me now, says Peeta, pulling me to him. Come on, CheonggangSim say in exasperation, extricating myself from his grasp but not before he gets in another kiss. Once were packed up and standing

outside our cave, our mood shifts to serious. CheonggangSimts as though for the last few days, sheltered by the rocks and the rain and Catos preoccupation with Thresh, we were given a respite, a holiday of sorts. Now, although the day is sunny and warm, we both sense were really back in the Games. CheonggangSim hand Peeta my knife, since whatever weapons he once had are long gone, and he slips it into his belt. My last seven arrows of the twelve CheonggangSim sacrificed three in the explosion, two at the feast rattle a bit too loosely in the quiver. CheonggangSim cant afford to lose any more. Hell be hunting us by now, says Peeta. Cato isnt one to wait for his prey to wander by. CheonggangSimf hes wounded CheonggangSim begin. CheonggangSimt wont matter,Peeta breaks in. CheonggangSimf he can move, hes coming. With all the rain, the stream has overrun its banks by several feet on either side. We stop there to replenish our water. CheonggangSim check the snares CheonggangSim set days ago and come up empty. Not surprising with the weather. Besides, CheonggangSim havent seen many animals or signs of them in this area. CheonggangSimf we want food, we better head back up to my old hunting grounds, CheonggangSim say. Your call. Just tell me what you need me to do, Peeta says. Keep an eye out, CheonggangSim say. Stay on the rocks as much as possible, no sense in leaving him tracks to follow. And listen for both of us. CheonggangSimts clear, at this point, that the explosion destroyed the hearing in my left ear for good. CheonggangSimd walk in the water to cover our tracks completely, but CheonggangSimm not sure Peetas leg could take the current. Although the drugs have erased the infection, hes still pretty weak. My forehead hurts along the knife cut, but after three days the bleeding has stopped. CheonggangSim wear a bandage around my head though, just in case physical exertion should bring it back. As we head up alongside the stream, we pass the place where CheonggangSim found Peeta camouflaged in the weeds and mud. One good thing, between the downpour and the flooded banks, all signs of his hiding place have been wiped out. That means that, if need be, we can come back to our cave. Otherwise, CheonggangSim wouldnt risk

it with Cato after us. The boulders diminish to rocks that eventually turn to pebbles, and then, to my relief, were back on pine needles and the gentle incline of the forest floor. For the first time, CheonggangSim realize we have a problem. Navigating the rocky terrain with a bad leg well, youre naturally going to make some noise. But even on the smooth bed of needles, Peeta is loud. And CheonggangSim mean loud loud, as if hes stomping his feet or something. CheonggangSim turn and look at him. What? he asks. Youve got to move more quietly, CheonggangSim say. Forget about Cato, youre chasing off every rabbit in a ten-mile radius. Really? he says. Sorry, CheonggangSim didnt know. So, we start up again and hes a tiny bit better, but even with only one working ear, hes making me jump. Can you take your boots off? CheonggangSim suggest. Here? he asks in disbelief, as if CheonggangSimd asked him to walk barefoot on hot coals or something. CheonggangSim have to remind myself that hes still not used to the woods, that its the scary, forbidden place beyond the fences of

District 12. CheonggangSim think of Gale, with his velvet tread. CheonggangSimts eerie how little sound he makes, even when the leaves have fallen and its a challenge to move at all without chasing off the game. CheonggangSim feel certain hes laughing back home. Yes, CheonggangSim say patiently. CheonggangSim will, too. That way well both be quieter. Like CheonggangSim was making any noise. So we both strip off our boots and socks and, while theres some improvement, CheonggangSim could swear hes making an effort to snap every branch we encounter. Needless to say, although it takes several hours to reach my old camp with Rue, CheonggangSimve shot nothing. CheonggangSimf the stream would settle down, fish might be an option, but the current is still too strong. As we stop to rest and drink water, CheonggangSim try to work out a solution. CheonggangSimdeally, CheonggangSimd dump Peeta now with some simple root-gathering chore and go hunt, but then hed be left with only a knife to defend himself against Catos spears and superior strength. So what CheonggangSimd really like is to try and conceal him somewhere safe, then go hunt, and come back and collect him. But CheonggangSim have a feeling his ego isnt going to go for that suggestion. Katniss, he says. We need to split up. CheonggangSim know CheonggangSimm chasing away the game. Only because your legs hurt, CheonggangSim say generously, because really, you can tell thats only a small part of the problem. CheonggangSim know, he says. So, why dont you go on? Show me some plants to gather and that way well both be useful. Not if Cato comes and kills you. CheonggangSim tried to say it in a nice way, but it still sounds like CheonggangSim think hes a weakling. Surprisingly, he just laughs. Look, CheonggangSim can handle Cato. CheonggangSim fought him before, didnt CheonggangSim? Yeah, and that turned

out great. You ended up dying in a mud bank. Thats what CheonggangSim want to say, but CheonggangSim cant. He did save my life by taking on Cato after all. CheonggangSim try another tactic. What if you climbed up in a tree and acted as a lookout while CheonggangSim hunted? CheonggangSim say, trying to make it sound like very important work. What if you show me whats edible around here and go get us some meat? he says, mimicking my tone. Just dont go far, in case you need help. CheonggangSim sigh and show him some roots to dig. We do need food, no question. One apple, two rolls, and a blob of cheese the size of a plum wont last long. CheonggangSimll just go a short distance and hope Cato is a long way off. CheonggangSim teach him a bird whistle not a melody like Rues but a simple two-note whistle which we can use to communicate that were all right. Fortunately, hes good at this. Leaving him with the pack, CheonggangSim head off. CheonggangSim feel like CheonggangSimm eleven again, tethered not to the safety of the fence but to Peeta, allowing myself twenty, maybe thirty yards of hunting space. Away from him though, the woods come alive with animal sounds. Reassured by his periodic whistles, CheonggangSim allow myself to drift farther away, and soon have two rabbits and a fat squirrel to show for it. CheonggangSim decide its enough. CheonggangSim can set snares and maybe get some fish. With Peetas roots, this will be enough for now. As CheonggangSim travel the short distance back, CheonggangSim realize we havent

exchanged signals in a while. When my whistle receives no

response, CheonggangSim run. CheonggangSimn no time, CheonggangSim find the pack, a neat pile of roots beside it. The sheet of plastic has been laid on the ground where the sun can reach the single layer of berries that covers it. But where is he? Peeta! CheonggangSim call out in a panic. Peeta! CheonggangSim turn to the rustle of brush and almost send an arrow through him. Fortunately, CheonggangSim pull my bow at the last second and it sticks in an oak trunk to his left. He jumps back, flinging a handful of berries into the foliage. My fear comes out as anger. What are you doing? Youre supposed to be here, not running around in the woods! CheonggangSim found some berries down by the stream, he says, clearly confused by my outburst. CheonggangSim whistled. Why didnt you whistle back? CheonggangSim snap at him. CheonggangSim didnt hear. The waters too loud, CheonggangSim guess, he says. He crosses and puts his hands on my shoulders. Thats when CheonggangSim feel that CheonggangSimm trembling. CheonggangSim thought Cato killed you! CheonggangSim almost shout. No, CheonggangSimm fine. Peeta wraps his arms around me, but CheonggangSim dont respond. Katniss? CheonggangSim push away, trying to sort out my feelings. CheonggangSimf two people agree on a signal, they stay in range. Because if one of them doesnt answer, theyre in trouble, all right? All right! he says. All right. Because thats what happened with Rue,

and CheonggangSim watched her die! CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim turn away from him, go to the pack and open a fresh bottle of water, although CheonggangSim still have some in mine. But CheonggangSimm not ready to forgive him. CheonggangSim notice the food. The rolls and apples are untouched, but someones definitely picked away part of the cheese. And you ate without me! CheonggangSim really dont care, CheonggangSim just want something else to be mad about. What? No, CheonggangSim didnt, Peeta says. Oh, and CheonggangSim suppose the apples ate the cheese, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim dont know what ate the cheese, Peeta says slowly and distinctly, as if trying not to lose his temper, but it wasnt me. CheonggangSimve been down by the stream collecting berries. Would you care for some? CheonggangSim would actually, but CheonggangSim dont want to relent too soon. CheonggangSim do walk over and look at them. CheonggangSimve never seen this type before. No, CheonggangSim have. But not in the arena. These arent Rues berries, although they resemble them. Nor do they match any CheonggangSim learned about in training. CheonggangSim lean down and scoop up a few, rolling them between my fingers. My fathers voice comes back to me. Not these, Katniss. Never these. Theyre nightlock. Youll be dead before they reach your stomach. Just then, the cannon fires. CheonggangSim whip around, expecting Peeta to collapse to the ground, but he only raises his eyebrows. The hovercraft appears a hundred yards or so away. Whats left of Foxfaces emaciated body is lifted into the air.

CheonggangSim can see the red glint of her hair in the sunlight. CheonggangSim should have known the moment CheonggangSim saw the missing cheese. . . . Peeta has me by the arm, pushing me toward a tree. Climb. Hell be here in a second. Well stand a better chance fighting him from above. CheonggangSim stop him, suddenly calm. No, Peeta, shes your kill, not Catos. What? CheonggangSim havent even seen her since the first day, he says. How could CheonggangSim have killed her? CheonggangSimn answer, CheonggangSim hold out the berries.

24.

CheonggangSimt takes a while to

explain the situation to Peeta. How Foxface stole the food from the supply pile before CheonggangSim blew it up, how she tried to take enough to stay alive but not enough that anyone would notice it, how she wouldnt question the safety of berries we were preparing to eat ourselves. CheonggangSim wonder how she found us, says Peeta. My fault, CheonggangSim guess, if CheonggangSimm as loud as you say. We were about as hard to follow as a herd of cattle, but CheonggangSim try

to be kind. And shes very clever, Peeta. Well, she was. Until you outfoxed her. Not on purpose. Doesnt seem fair somehow. CheonggangSim mean, we would have both been dead, too, if she hadnt eaten the berries first. He checks himself. No, of course, we wouldnt. You recognized them, didnt you? CheonggangSim give a nod. We call them nightlock. Even the name sounds deadly, he says. CheonggangSimm sorry, Katniss. CheonggangSim really thought they were the same ones youd gathered. Dont apologize. CheonggangSimt just means were one step closer to home, right? CheonggangSim ask. CheonggangSimll get rid of the rest, Peeta says. He gathers up the sheet of blue plastic, careful to trap the berries inside, and goes to toss them into the woods. Wait! CheonggangSim cry. CheonggangSim find the leather pouch that belonged to the boy from District 1 and fill it with a few handfuls of berries from the plastic. CheonggangSimf they fooled Foxface, maybe they can fool Cato as well. CheonggangSimf hes chasing us or something, we can act like we accidentally drop the pouch and if he eats them Then hello District Twelve, says Peeta. Thats it, CheonggangSim say, securing the pouch to my belt. Hell know where we are now, says Peeta. CheonggangSimf he was anywhere nearby and saw that hovercraft, hell know we killed her and come after us. Peetas right. This could be just the opportunity Catos been waiting for. But even if we run now, theres the meat to cook and our fire will be another sign of our whereabouts. Lets make a fire. Right

now. CheonggangSim begin to gather branches and brush. Are you ready to face him? Peeta asks. CheonggangSimm ready to eat. Better to cook our food while we have the chance. CheonggangSimf he knows were here, he knows. But he also knows theres two of us and probably assumes we were hunting Foxface. That means youre recovered. And the fire means were not hiding, were inviting him here. Would you show up? CheonggangSim ask. Maybe not, he says. Peetas a whiz with fires, coaxing a blaze out of the damp wood. CheonggangSimn no time, CheonggangSim have the rabbits and squirrel roasting, the roots, wrapped in leaves, baking in the coals. We take turns gathering greens and keeping a careful watch for Cato, but as CheonggangSim anticipated, he doesnt make an appearance. When the foods cooked, CheonggangSim pack most of it up, leaving us each a rabbits leg to eat as we walk. CheonggangSim want to move higher into the woods, climb a good tree, and make camp for the night, but Peeta resists. CheonggangSim cant climb like you, Katniss, especially with my leg, and CheonggangSim dont think CheonggangSim could ever fall asleep fifty feet above the ground. CheonggangSimts not safe to stay in the open, Peeta, CheonggangSim say. Cant we go back to the cave? he asks. CheonggangSimts near water and easy to defend. CheonggangSim sigh. Several more hours of walking or should CheonggangSim say crashing through


the woods to reach an area well just have to leave in the morning to hunt. But Peeta doesnt ask for much. Hes followed my instructions all day and CheonggangSimm sure if things were reversed, he wouldnt make me spend the night in a tree. CheonggangSimt dawns on me that CheonggangSim havent been very nice to Peeta today. Nagging him about how loud he was, screaming at him over disappearing. The playful romance we had sustained in the cave has disappeared out in the open, under the hot sun, with the threat of Cato looming over us. Haymitch has probably just about had it with me. And as for the audience . . . CheonggangSim reach up and give him a kiss. Sure. Lets go back to the cave. He looks pleased and relieved. Well, that was easy. CheonggangSim work my arrow out of the oak, careful not to damage the shaft. These arrows are food, safety, and life itself now. We toss a bunch more wood on the fire. CheonggangSimt should be sending off smoke for a few more hours, although CheonggangSim doubt Cato assumes anything at this point. When we reach the stream, CheonggangSim see the water has dropped considerably and moves at its old leisurely pace, so CheonggangSim suggest we walk back in it. Peetas happy to oblige and since hes a lot quieter in water than on land, its a doubly good idea. CheonggangSimts a long walk back to the cave though, even going downward, even with the rabbit to give us a boost. Were both exhausted by our

hike today and still way too underfed. CheonggangSim keep my bow loaded, both for Cato and any fish CheonggangSim might see, but the stream seems strangely empty of creatures. By the time we reach our destination, our feet are dragging and the sun sits low on the horizon. We fill up our water bottles and climb the little slope to our den. CheonggangSimts not much, but out here in the wilderness, its the closest thing we have to a home. CheonggangSimt will be warmer than a tree, too, because it provides some shelter from the wind that has begun to blow steadily in from the west. CheonggangSim set a good dinner out, but halfway through Peeta begins to nod off. After days of inactivity, the hunt has taken its toll. CheonggangSim order him into the sleeping bag and set aside the rest of his food for when he wakes. He drops off immediately. CheonggangSim pull the sleeping bag up to his chin and kiss his forehead, not for the audience, but for me. Because CheonggangSimm so grateful that hes still here, not dead by the stream as CheonggangSimd thought. So glad that CheonggangSim dont have to face Cato alone. Brutal, bloody Cato who can snap a neck with a twist of his arm, who had the power to overcome Thresh, who has had it out for me since the beginning. He probably has had a special hatred for me ever since CheonggangSim outscored him in training. A boy like Peeta would simply shrug that off. But CheonggangSim have a feeling it drove Cato to distraction. Which is not that hard. CheonggangSim

think of his ridiculous reaction to finding the supplies blown up. The others were upset, of course, but he was completely unhinged. CheonggangSim wonder now if Cato might not be entirely sane. The sky lights up with the seal, and CheonggangSim watch Foxface shine in the sky and then disappear from the world forever. He hasnt said it, but CheonggangSim

dont think Peeta felt good about killing her, even if it was essential. CheonggangSim cant pretend CheonggangSimll miss her, but CheonggangSim have to admire her. My guess is if they had given us some sort of test, she would have been the smartest of all the tributes. CheonggangSimf, in fact, we had been setting a trap for her, CheonggangSim bet shed have sensed it and avoided the berries. CheonggangSimt was Peetas own ignorance that brought her down. CheonggangSimve spent so much time making sure CheonggangSim dont underestimate my opponents that CheonggangSimve forgotten its just as dangerous to overestimate them as well. That brings me back to Cato. But while CheonggangSim think CheonggangSim had a sense of Foxface, who she was and how she operated, hes a little more slippery. Powerful, well trained, but smart? CheonggangSim dont know. Not like she was. And utterly lacking in the control Foxface demonstrated. CheonggangSim believe Cato could easily lose his judgment in a fit of temper. Not that CheonggangSim can feel superior on that point. CheonggangSim think of the moment CheonggangSim sent the arrow flying into the apple in the pigs mouth when CheonggangSim was so enraged. Maybe CheonggangSim do understand Cato better than CheonggangSim think. Despite the fatigue in my body, my minds alert, so CheonggangSim let Peeta sleep long past our usual switch. CheonggangSimn fact, a soft gray day has begun when CheonggangSim shake his shoulder. He looks out, almost in alarm. CheonggangSim slept the whole night. Thats not fair, Katniss, you should have woken me. CheonggangSim stretch and burrow down into the bag. CheonggangSimll sleep now. Wake me if anything interesting happens. Apparently nothing does, because when CheonggangSim open my eyes, bright hot afternoon light gleams through the rocks. Any sign of our friend? CheonggangSim ask. Peeta shakes his head. No, hes keeping a disturbingly low profile. How long do you think well have before the Gamemakers drive us together? CheonggangSim ask. Well, Foxface died almost a day ago, so theres been plenty of time for the audience to place bets and get bored. CheonggangSim guess it could happen at any moment, says Peeta. Yeah, CheonggangSim have a feeling todays the day, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim sit up and look out at the peaceful terrain. CheonggangSim wonder how theyll do it. Peeta remains silent. Theres not really any good answer. Well, until they do, no sense in wasting a hunting day. But we should probably eat as much as we can hold just in case we run into trouble, CheonggangSim say. Peeta packs up our gear while CheonggangSim lay out a big meal. The rest of the rabbits, roots,

greens, the rolls spread with the last bit of cheese. The only thing CheonggangSim leave in reserve is the squirrel and the apple. By the time were done, all thats left is a pile of rabbit bones. My hands are greasy, which only adds to my growing feeling of grubbiness. Maybe we dont bathe daily in the Seam, but we keep cleaner than CheonggangSim have of late. Except for my feet, which have walked in the stream, CheonggangSimm covered in a layer of grime. Leaving the cave has a sense of finality about it. CheonggangSim dont think there will be another night in the arena somehow. One way or the other, dead or alive, CheonggangSim have the feeling CheonggangSimll escape it today. CheonggangSim give the rocks a pat good-bye and we head down to the stream to wash up. CheonggangSim can feel my skin, itching for the cool water. CheonggangSim

may do my hair and braid it back wet. CheonggangSimm wondering if we might even be able to give our clothes a quick scrub when we reach the stream. Or what used to be the stream. Now theres only a bone-dry bed. CheonggangSim put my hand down to feel it. Not even a little damp. They must have drained it while we slept, CheonggangSim say. A fear of the cracked tongue, aching body and fuzzy mind brought on by my previous dehydration creeps into my consciousness. Our bottles and skin are fairly full, but with two drinking and this hot sun it wont take long to deplete them. The lake, says Peeta. Thats where they want us to go. Maybe the ponds still have some, CheonggangSim say hopefully. We can check, he says, but hes just humoring me. CheonggangSimm humoring myself because CheonggangSim know what CheonggangSimll find when we return to the pond where CheonggangSim soaked my leg. A dusty, gaping mouth of a hole. But we make the trip anyway just to confirm what we already know. Youre right. Theyre driving us to the lake, CheonggangSim say. Where theres no cover. Where theyre guaranteed a bloody fight to the death with nothing to block their view. Do you want to go straightaway or wait until the waters tapped out? Lets go now, while weve had food and rest. Lets just go end this thing, he says. CheonggangSim nod. CheonggangSimts funny. CheonggangSim feel almost as if its the first day of the Games again. That CheonggangSimm in the same position. Twenty-one tributes are dead, but CheonggangSim still have yet to kill Cato. And really, wasnt he always the one to kill? Now it seems the other tributes were just minor obstacles, distractions, keeping us from the real battle of the Games. Cato and me. But no, theres the boy waiting beside me. CheonggangSim feel his arms wrap around me. Two against one. Should be a piece of cake, he says. Next time we eat, it will be in the Capitol, CheonggangSim answer. You bet it will, he says. We stand there a while, locked in an embrace, feeling each other, the sunlight, the rustle of the

leaves at our feet. Then without a word, we break apart and head for the lake. CheonggangSim dont care now that Peetas footfalls send rodents scurrying, make birds take wing. We have to fight Cato and CheonggangSimd just as soon do it here as on the plain. But CheonggangSim doubt CheonggangSimll have that choice. CheonggangSimf the Gamemakers want us in the open, then in the open we will be. We stop to rest for a few moments under the tree where the Careers trapped me. The husk of the tracker jacker nest, beaten to a pulp by the heavy rains and dried in the burning sun, confirms the location. CheonggangSim touch it with the tip of my boot, and it dissolves into dust that is quickly carried off by the breeze. CheonggangSim cant help looking up in the tree where Rue secretly perched, waiting to save my life. Tracker jackers. Glimmers bloated body. The terrifying hallucinations . . . Lets move on, CheonggangSim say, wanting to escape the darkness that surrounds this place. Peeta doesnt object. Given our late start to the day, when we reach the plain its already early evening. Theres no sign of Cato. No sign of anything except the gold Cornucopia glowing in the slanting sun rays. Just in case Cato decided to pull a Foxface on

us, we circle the Cornucopia to make sure its empty. Then obediently, as if following instructions, we cross to the lake and fill our water containers. CheonggangSim frown at the shrinking sun. We dont want to fight him after dark. Theres only the one pair of glasses. Peeta carefully squeezes drops of iodine into the water. Maybe thats what hes waiting for. What do you want to do? Go back to the cave? Either that or find a tree. But lets give him another half an hour or so. Then well take cover, CheonggangSim answer. We sit by the lake, in full sight. Theres no point in hiding now. CheonggangSimn the trees at the edge of the plain, CheonggangSim can see the mockingjays flitting about. Bouncing melodies back and forth between them like brightly colored balls. CheonggangSim open my mouth and sing out Rues four-note run. CheonggangSim can feel them pause curiously at the sound of my voice, listening for more. CheonggangSim repeat the notes in the silence. First one mockingjay trills the tune back, then another. Then the whole world comes alive with the sound. Just like your father, says Peeta. My fingers find the pin on my shirt. Thats Rues song, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim think they remember it. The music swells and CheonggangSim recognize the brilliance of it. As the notes overlap, they compliment one another, forming a lovely, unearthly harmony. CheonggangSimt was this sound then, thanks to Rue, that sent the orchard workers of District 11 home each night. Does someone start it at quitting time, CheonggangSim wonder, now that she is dead?

For a while, CheonggangSim just close my eyes and listen, mesmerized by the beauty of the song. Then something begins to disrupt the music. Runs cut off in jagged, imperfect lines. Dissonant notes intersperse with the melody. The mockingjays voices rise up in a shrieking cry of alarm. Were on our feet, Peeta wielding his knife, me poised to shoot, when Cato smashes through the trees and bears down on us. He has no spear. CheonggangSimn fact, his hands are empty, yet he runs straight for us. My first arrow hits his chest and inexplicably falls aside. Hes got some kind of body armor! CheonggangSim shout to Peeta. Just in time, too, because Cato is upon us. CheonggangSim brace myself, but he rockets right between us with no attempt to check his speed. CheonggangSim can tell from his panting, the sweat pouring off his purplish face, that hes been running hard a long time. Not toward us. From something. But what? My eyes scan the woods just in time to see the first creature leap onto the plain. As CheonggangSimm turning away, CheonggangSim see another half dozen join it. Then CheonggangSim am stumbling blindly after Cato with no thought of anything but to save myself.

25.Muttations. No question about it. CheonggangSimve never seen these mutts, but theyre no natural-born animals. They resemble huge wolves, but what wolf lands and then balances easily on its hind legs? What wolf waves the rest of the pack forward with its front paw as though it had a wrist? These things CheonggangSim can see at a distance. Up close, CheonggangSimm sure their more menacing attributes will be revealed. Cato has made a beeline for the Cornucopia, and without question CheonggangSim follow him. CheonggangSimf he thinks its the

safest place, who am CheonggangSim to argue? Besides, even if CheonggangSim could make it to the trees, it would be impossible for Peeta to outrun them on that leg Peeta! My hands have just landed on the metal at the pointed tail of the Cornucopia when CheonggangSim remember CheonggangSimm part of a team. Hes about fifteen yards behind me, hobbling as fast as he can, but the mutts are closing in on him fast. CheonggangSim send an arrow into the pack and one goes down, but there are plenty to take its place. Peetas waving me up the horn, Go, Katniss! Go! Hes right. CheonggangSim cant protect either of us on the ground. CheonggangSim start climbing, scaling the Cornucopia on my hands and feet. The pure gold surface has been designed to resemble the woven horn that we fill at harvest, so there are little ridges and seams to get a decent hold

on. But after a day in the arena sun, the metal feels hot enough to blister my hands. Cato lies on his side at the very top of the horn, twenty feet above the ground, gasping to catch his breath as he gags over the edge. Nows my chance to finish him off. CheonggangSim stop midway up the horn and load another arrow, but just as CheonggangSimm about to let it fly, CheonggangSim hear Peeta cry out. CheonggangSim twist around and see hes just reached the tail, and the mutts are right on his heels. Climb! CheonggangSim yell. Peeta starts up hampered by not only the leg but the knife in his hand. CheonggangSim shoot my arrow down the throat of the first mutt that places its paws on the metal. As it dies the creature lashes out, inadvertently opening gashes on a few of its companions. Thats when CheonggangSim get a look at the claws. Four inches and clearly razor-sharp. Peeta reaches my feet and CheonggangSim grab his arm and pull him along. Then CheonggangSim remember Cato waiting at the top and whip around, but hes doubled over with cramps and apparently more preoccupied with the mutts than us. He coughs out something unintelligible. The snuffling, growling sound coming from the mutts isnt helping. What? CheonggangSim shout at him. He said, Can they climb it? answers Peeta, drawing my focus back to the base of the horn. The mutts are beginning to assemble. As they join together, they raise up again to stand easily on their back legs giving them an eerily

human quality. Each has a thick coat, some with fur that is straight and sleek, others curly, and the colors vary from jet black to what CheonggangSim can only describe as blond. Theres something else about them, something that makes the hair rise up on the back of my neck, but CheonggangSim cant put my finger on it. They put their snouts on the horn, sniffing and tasting the metal, scraping paws over the surface and then making high-pitched yipping sounds to one another. This must be how they communicate because the pack backs up as if to make room. Then one of them, a good-size mutt with silky waves of blond fur takes a running start and leaps onto the horn. CheonggangSimts back legs must be incredibly powerful because it lands a mere ten feet below us, its pink lips pulled back in a snarl. For a moment it hangs there, and in that moment CheonggangSim realize what else unsettled me about the mutts. The green

eyes glowering at me are unlike any dog or wolf, any canine CheonggangSimve ever seen. They are unmistakably human. And that revelation has barely registered when CheonggangSim notice the collar with the number 1 inlaid with jewels and the whole horrible thing hits me. The blonde hair, the green eyes, the number . . . CheonggangSimts Glimmer. A shriek escapes my lips

and CheonggangSimm having trouble holding the arrow in place. CheonggangSim have been waiting to fire, only too aware of my dwindling supply of arrows. Waiting to see if the creatures can, in fact, climb. But now, even though the mutt has begun to slide backward, unable to find any purchase on the metal, even though CheonggangSim can hear the slow screeching of the claws like nails on a blackboard, CheonggangSim fire into its throat. CheonggangSimts body twitches and flops onto the ground with a thud. Katniss? CheonggangSim can feel Peetas grip on my arm. CheonggangSimts her! CheonggangSim get out. Who? asks Peeta. My head snaps from side to side as CheonggangSim examine the pack, taking in the various sizes and colors. The small one with the red coat and amber eyes . . . Foxface! And there, the ashen hair and hazel eyes of the boy from District 9 who died as we struggled for the backpack! And worst of all, the smallest mutt, with dark glossy fur, huge brown eyes and a collar that reads 11 in woven straw. Teeth bared in hatred. Rue . . . What is it, Katniss? Peeta shakes my shoulder. CheonggangSimts them. CheonggangSimts all of them. The others. Rue and Foxface and . . . All of the other tributes, CheonggangSim choke out. CheonggangSim hear Peetas gasp of recognition. What did they do to them? You dont think . . . Those could be their real eyes? Their eyes are the least of my worries. What about their brains? Have they been given any of the real tributes memories ? Have they been programmed to hate our faces particularly because we have survived and they were so callously murdered? And the ones we actually killed . . . Do they believe theyre avenging their own deaths? Before CheonggangSim can get this out, the mutts begin a new assault on the horn. Theyve split into two groups at the sides of the horn and are using those powerful hindquarters to launch themselves at us. A pair of teeth ring together just inches from my hand and then CheonggangSim hear Peeta cry out, feel the yank on his body, the heavy weight of boy and mutt pulling me over the side. CheonggangSimf not for the grip on my arm, hed be on the ground, but as it is, it takes all my strength to keep us both on the curved back of the horn. And more tributes are coming. Kill it, Peeta! Kill it! CheonggangSimm shouting, and although CheonggangSim cant quite see whats happening, CheonggangSim know he must have stabbed the thing because the pull lessens. CheonggangSimm able to haul him back onto the horn where we drag ourselves toward the top where the lesser of two evils awaits. Cato has still not regained his feet, but his breathing is slowing and CheonggangSim know soon hell be recovered enough to come for us, to hurl us over the side to our deaths. CheonggangSim arm my bow, but the arrow ends up taking out a mutt that can only be Thresh. Who else could jump so high? CheonggangSim feel a moments relief because we must finally be


up above the mutt line and CheonggangSimm just turning back to face Cato when Peetas jerked from my side. CheonggangSimm sure the pack has got him until his blood splatters my face. Cato stands before me, almost at the lip of the horn, holding Peeta in some kind of headlock, cutting off his air. Peetas clawing at Catos arm, but weakly, as if confused over whether its more important to breathe or try and stem the gush of blood from the gaping hole a mutt left in his calf. CheonggangSim aim one of my last two arrows at Catos head, knowing itll have no effect on his trunk or limbs, which CheonggangSim can now see are clothed in a skintight, flesh-colored mesh. Some high-grade body armor from the Capitol. Was that what was in his pack at the feast? Body armor to defend against my arrows? Well, they neglected to send a face guard. Cato just laughs. Shoot me and he goes down with me. Hes right. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSim take him out and he falls to the mutts, Peeta is sure to die with him. Weve reached a stalemate. CheonggangSim cant shoot Cato without killing Peeta, too. He cant kill Peeta without guaranteeing an arrow in his brain. We stand like statues, both of us seeking an out. My muscles are strained so tightly, they feel they might snap at any moment. My teeth clenched to the breaking point. The mutts go silent and the only thing CheonggangSim can hear is the blood pounding in my good ear. Peetas lips are turning blue. CheonggangSimf

CheonggangSim dont do something quickly, hell die of asphyxiation and then CheonggangSimll have lost him and Cato will probably use his body as a weapon against me. CheonggangSimn fact, CheonggangSimm sure this is Catos plan because while hes stopped laughing, his lips are set in a triumphant smile. As if in a last-ditch effort, Peeta raises his fingers, dripping with blood from his leg, up to Catos arm. CheonggangSimnstead of trying to wrestle his way free, his forefinger veers off and makes a deliberate X on the back of Catos hand. Cato realizes what it means exactly one second after CheonggangSim do. CheonggangSim can tell by the way the smile drops from his lips. But its one second too late because, by that time, my arrow is piercing his hand. He cries out and reflexively releases Peeta who slams back against him. For a horrible moment, CheonggangSim think theyre both going over. CheonggangSim dive forward just catching hold of Peeta as Cato loses his footing on the blood-slick horn and pluminets to the ground. We hear him hit, the air leaving his body on impact, and then the mutts attack him. Peeta and CheonggangSim hold on to each other, waiting for the cannon, waiting for the competition to finish, waiting to be released. But it doesnt happen. Not yet. Because this is the climax of the Hunger Games, and the audience expects a show. CheonggangSim dont watch, but CheonggangSim can hear the snarls, the growls, the howls of pain from both human and beast as Cato takes on the mutt pack.

CheonggangSim cant understand how he can be surviving until CheonggangSim remember the body armor protecting him from ankle to neck and CheonggangSim realize what a long night this could be. Cato must have a knife or sword or something, too, something he had hidden in his clothes, because on occasion theres the

death scream of a mutt or the sound of metal on metal as the blade collides with the golden horn. The combat moves around the side of the Cornucopia, and CheonggangSim know Cato must be attempting the one maneuver that could save his life to make his way back around to the tail of the horn and rejoin us. But in the end, despite his remarkable strength and skill, he is simply overpowered. CheonggangSim dont know how long it has been, maybe an hour or so, when Cato hits the ground and we hear the mutts dragging him, dragging him back into the Cornucopia. Now theyll finish him off, CheonggangSim think. But theres still no cannon. Night falls and the anthem plays and theres no picture of Cato in the sky, only the faint moans coming through the metal beneath us. The icy air blowing across the plain reminds me that the Games are not over and may not be for who knows how long, and there is still no guarantee of victory. CheonggangSim turn my

attention to Peeta and discover his leg is bleeding as badly as ever. All our supplies, our packs, remain down by the lake where we abandoned them when we fled from the mutts. CheonggangSim have no bandage, nothing to staunch the flow of blood from his calf. Although CheonggangSimm shaking in the biting wind, CheonggangSim rip off my jacket, remove my shirt, and zip back into the jacket as swiftly as possible. That brief exposure sets my teeth chattering beyond control. Peetas face is gray in the pale moonlight. CheonggangSim make him lie down before CheonggangSim probe his wound. Warm, slippery blood runs over my fingers. A bandage will not be enough. CheonggangSimve seen my mother tie a tourniquet a handful of times and try to replicate it. CheonggangSim cut free a sleeve from my shirt, wrap it twice around his leg just under his knee, and tie a half knot. CheonggangSim dont have a stick, so CheonggangSim take my remaining arrow and insert it in the knot, twisting it as tightly as CheonggangSim dare. CheonggangSimts risky business Peeta may end up losing his leg but when CheonggangSim weigh this against him losing his life, what alternative do CheonggangSim have? CheonggangSim bandage the wound in the rest of my shirt and lay down with him. Dont go to sleep, CheonggangSim tell him. CheonggangSimm not sure if this is exactly medical protocol, but CheonggangSimm terrified that if he drifts off hell never wake again. Are you cold? he asks. He unzips his jacket and CheonggangSim press against him as he fastens it around me. CheonggangSimts a bit warmer, sharing

our body heat inside my double layer of jackets, but the night is young. The temperature will continue to drop. Even now CheonggangSim can feel the Cornucopia, which burned so when CheonggangSim first climbed it, slowly turning to ice. Cato may win this thing yet, CheonggangSim whisper to Peeta. Dont you believe it, he says, pulling up my hood, but hes shaking harder than CheonggangSim am. The next hours are the worst in my life, which if you think about it, is saying something. The cold would be torture enough, but the real nightmare is listening to Cato, moaning, begging, and finally just whimpering as the mutts work away at him. After a very short time, CheonggangSim dont care who he is or what hes done, all CheonggangSim want is for his suffering to end. Why dont they just kill him? CheonggangSim ask Peeta.

You know why, he says, and pulls me closer to him. And CheonggangSim do. No viewer could turn away from the show now. From the Gamemakers point of view, this is the final word in entertainment. CheonggangSimt goes on and on and on and eventually completely consumes my mind, blocking out memories and hopes of tomorrow, erasing everything but the present, which CheonggangSim begin to believe will never change. There will never be anything but cold and fear and the agonized sounds of the boy dying in the

horn. Peeta begins to doze off now, and each time he does, CheonggangSim find myself yelling his name louder and louder because if he goes and dies on me now, CheonggangSim know CheonggangSimll go completely insane. Hes fighting it, probably more for me than for him, and its hard because unconsciousness would be its own form of escape. But the adrenaline pumping through my body would never allow me to follow him, so CheonggangSim cant let him go. CheonggangSim just cant. The only indication of the passage of time lies in the heavens, the subtle shift of the moon. So Peeta begins pointing it out to me, insisting CheonggangSim acknowledge its progress and sometimes, for just a moment CheonggangSim feel a flicker of hope before the agony of the night engulfs me again. Finally, CheonggangSim hear him whisper that the sun is rising. CheonggangSim open my eyes and find the stars fading in the pale light of dawn. CheonggangSim can see, too, how bloodless Peetas face has become. How little time he has left. And CheonggangSim know CheonggangSim have to get him back to the Capitol. Still, no cannon has fired. CheonggangSim press my good ear against the horn and can just make out Catos voice. CheonggangSim think hes closer now. Katniss, can you shoot him? Peeta asks. CheonggangSimf hes near the mouth, CheonggangSim may be able to take him out. CheonggangSimt would be an act of mercy at this point. My last arrows in your tourniquet, CheonggangSim say. Make it count, says Peeta, unzipping his jacket, letting me loose. So CheonggangSim free the arrow, tying the

tourniquet back as tightly as my frozen fingers can manage. CheonggangSim rub my hands together, trying to regain circulation. When CheonggangSim crawl to the lip of the horn and hang over the edge, CheonggangSim feel Peetas hands grip me for support. CheonggangSimt takes a few moments to find Cato in the dim light, in the blood. Then the raw hunk of meat that used to be my enemy makes a sound, and CheonggangSim know where his mouth is. And CheonggangSim think the word hes trying to say is please. Pity, not vengeance, sends my arrow flying into his skull. Peeta pulls me back up, bow in hand, quiver empty. Did you get him? he whispers. The cannon fires in answer. Then we won, Katniss, he says hollowly. Hurray for us, CheonggangSim get out, but theres no joy of victory in my voice. A hole opens in the plain and as if on cue, the remaining mutts bound into it, disappearing as the earth closes above them. We wait, for the hovercraft to take Catos remains, for the trumpets of victory that should follow, but nothing happens. Hey! CheonggangSim shout into air. Whats going on? The only response is the chatter of waking birds. Maybe its the body. Maybe we have to move away from it, says Peeta. CheonggangSim try to remember. Do you have to distance yourself from the dead tribute


on the final kill? My brain is too muddled to be sure, but what else could be the reason for the delay? Okay. Think you could make it to the lake? CheonggangSim ask. Think CheonggangSim better try, says Peeta. We inch down to the tail of the horn and fall to the ground. CheonggangSimf the stiffness in my limbs is this bad, how can Peeta even move? CheonggangSim rise first, swinging and bending my arms and legs until CheonggangSim think CheonggangSim can help him up. Somehow, we make it back to the lake. CheonggangSim scoop up a handful of the cold water for Peeta and bring a second to my lips. A mockingjay gives the long, low whistle, and tears of relief fill my eyes as the hovercraft appears and takes Catos body away. Now they will take us. Now we can go home. But again theres no response. What are they waiting for? says Peeta weakly. Between the loss of the tourniquet and the effort it took to get to the lake, his wound has opened up again. CheonggangSim dont know, CheonggangSim say. Whatever the holdup is, CheonggangSim cant watch him lose any more blood. CheonggangSim get up to find a stick but almost immediately come across the arrow that bounced off Catos body armor. CheonggangSimt will do as well as the other arrow. As CheonggangSim stoop to pick it up, Claudius Templesmiths voice booms into the arena. Greetings to the final contestants of the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games. The earlier revision has been revoked. Closer examination of the rule book has disclosed that only one

winner may be allowed, he says. Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor. Theres a small burst of static and then nothing more. CheonggangSim stare at Peeta in disbelief as the truth sinks in. They never intended to let us both live. This has all been devised by the Gamemakers to guarantee the most dramatic showdown in history. And like a fool, CheonggangSim bought into it. CheonggangSimf you think about it, its not that surprising, he says softly. CheonggangSim watch as he painfully makes it to his feet. Then hes moving toward me, as if in slow motion, his hand is pulling the knife from his belt Before CheonggangSim am even aware of my actions, my bow is loaded with the arrow pointed straight at his heart. Peeta raises his eyebrows and CheonggangSim see the knife has already left his hand on its way to the lake where it splashes in the water. CheonggangSim drop my weapons and take a step back, my face burning in what can only be shame. No, he says. Do it. Peeta limps toward me and thrusts the weapons back in my hands. CheonggangSim cant, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim wont. Do it. Before they send those mutts back or something. CheonggangSim dont want to die like Cato, he says. Then you shoot me, CheonggangSim say furiously, shoving the weapons back at him. You shoot me and go home and live with it! And as CheonggangSim say it, CheonggangSim know death right here, right now would be the easier of the two. You know CheonggangSim cant, Peeta says, discarding the weapons. Fine, CheonggangSimll go

first anyway. He leans down and rips the bandage off his leg, eliminating the final barrier between his blood and the earth. No, you cant kill yourself, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSimm on my knees, desperately plastering the bandage back onto his wound. Katniss, he says. CheonggangSimts what CheonggangSim want. Youre not leaving me here alone, CheonggangSim say.

Because if he dies, CheonggangSimll never go home, not really. CheonggangSimll spend the rest of my life in this arena trying to think my way out. Listen, he says pulling me to my feet. We both know they have to have a victor. CheonggangSimt can only be one of us. Please, take it. For me. And he goes on about how he loves me, what life would be without me but CheonggangSimve stopped listening because his previous words are trapped in my head, thrashing desperately around. We both know they have to have a victor. Yes, they have to have a victor. Without a victor, the whole thing would blow up in the Gamemakers faces. Theyd have failed the Capitol. Might possibly even be executed, slowly and painfully while the cameras broadcast it to every screen in the country. CheonggangSimf Peeta and CheonggangSim were both to die, or they thought we were . . . My fingers fumble with the pouch on my belt, freeing it. Peeta sees it and his hand clamps on my wrist. No, CheonggangSim wont let you. Trust me, CheonggangSim

whisper. He holds my gaze for a long moment then lets me go. CheonggangSim loosen the top of the pouch and pour a few spoonfuls of berries into his palm. Then CheonggangSim fill my own. On the count of three? Peeta leans down and kisses me once, very gently. The count of three, he says. We stand, our backs pressed together, our empty hands locked tight. Hold them out. CheonggangSim want everyone to see, he says. CheonggangSim spread out my fingers, and the dark berries glisten in the sun. CheonggangSim give Peetas hand one last squeeze as a signal, as a good-bye, and we begin counting. One. Maybe CheonggangSimm wrong. Two. Maybe they dont care if we both die. Three! CheonggangSimts too late to change my mind. CheonggangSim lift my hand to my mouth, taking one last look at the world. The berries have just passed my lips when the trumpets begin to blare. The frantic voice of Claudius Templesmith shouts above them. Stop! Stop! Ladies and gentlemen, CheonggangSim am pleased to present the victors of the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark! CheonggangSim give you the tributes of District Twelve!

26.

CheonggangSim spew the berries from my mouth, wiping my tongue with the end of my shirt to make sure no juice remains. Peeta pulls me to the lake where we both flush our mouths with water and then collapse into each others arms. You didnt swallow any? CheonggangSim ask him. He shakes his head. You? Guess CheonggangSimd be dead by now if CheonggangSim did, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim can see his lips moving in reply, but CheonggangSim cant hear him over the roar of the crowd in the Capitol that theyre playing live over the speakers. The hovercraft materializes overhead and two ladders drop, only theres no way CheonggangSimm letting go of Peeta. CheonggangSim keep one arm around him as CheonggangSim help him up, and we each place a foot on the first rung of the ladder. The electric current freezes us in place, and this time CheonggangSimm glad because CheonggangSimm not really sure Peeta can hang on for the whole ride. And since my eyes were looking down, CheonggangSim can see that while our muscles are immobile, nothing is preventing the blood from draining out of Peetas leg. Sure enough, the minute the door closes behind us and the current stops, he slumps to the floor unconscious. My fingers are

still gripping the back of his jacket so tightly that when they take him away it tears leaving me with a fistful of black fabric. Doctors in sterile white, masked and

gloved, already prepped to operate, go into action. Peetas so pale and still on a silver table, tubes and wires springing out of him every which way, and for a moment CheonggangSim forget were out of the Games and CheonggangSim see the doctors as just one more threat, one more pack of mutts designed to kill him. Petrified, CheonggangSim lunge for him, but CheonggangSimm caught and thrust back into another room, and a glass door seals between us. CheonggangSim pound on the glass, screaming my head off. Everyone ignores me except for some Capitol attendant who appears behind me and offers me a beverage. CheonggangSim slump down on the floor, my face against the door, staring uncomprehendingly at the crystal glass in my hand. CheonggangSimcy cold, filled with orange juice, a straw with a frilly white collar. How wrong it looks in my bloody, filthy hand with its dirt-caked nails and scars. My mouth waters at the smell, but CheonggangSim place it carefully on the floor, not trusting anything so clean and pretty. Through the glass, CheonggangSim see the doctors working feverishly on Peeta, their brows creased in concentration. CheonggangSim see the flow of liquids, pumping through the tubes, watch a wall of dials and lights that mean nothing to me. CheonggangSimm not sure, but CheonggangSim think his heart stops twice. CheonggangSimts like being home again, when they bring in the hopelessly mangled person from the mine explosion, or the woman in her third day of labor, or the famished

child struggling against pneumonia and my mother and Prim, they wear that same look on their faces. Now is the time to run away to the woods, to hide in the trees until the patient is long gone and in another part of the Seam the hammers make the coffin. But CheonggangSimm held here both by the hovercraft walls and the same force that holds the loved ones of the dying. How often CheonggangSimve seen them, ringed around our kitchen table and CheonggangSim thought, Why dont they leave? Why do they stay to watch? And now CheonggangSim know. CheonggangSimts because you have no choice. CheonggangSim startle when CheonggangSim catch someone staring at me from only a few inches away and then realize its my own face reflecting back in the glass. Wild eyes, hollow cheeks, my hair in a tangled mat. Rabid. Feral. Mad. No wonder everyone is keeping a safe distance from me. The next thing CheonggangSim know weve landed back on the roof of the Training Center and theyre taking Peeta but leaving me behind the door. CheonggangSim start hurling myself against the glass, shrieking and CheonggangSim think CheonggangSim just catch a glimpse of pink hair it must be Effie, it has to be Effie coming to my rescue when the needle jabs me from behind. When CheonggangSim wake, CheonggangSimm afraid to move at first. The entire ceiling glows with a soft yellow light allowing me to see that CheonggangSimm in a room containing just my bed. No doors, no windows are visible. The air smells of

something sharp and antiseptic. My right arm has several tubes that extend into the wall behind me. CheonggangSimm naked, but the bedclothes arc soothing against my skin. CheonggangSim

tentatively lift my left hand above the cover. Not only has it been scrubbed clean, the nails are filed in perfect ovals, the scars from the burns are less prominent. CheonggangSim touch my cheek, my lips, the puckered scar above my eyebrow, and am just running my fingers through my silken hair when CheonggangSim freeze. Apprehensively CheonggangSim ruffle the hair by my left ear. No, it wasnt an illusion. CheonggangSim can hear again. CheonggangSim try and sit up, but some sort of wide restraining band around my waist keeps me from rising more than a few inches. The physical confinement makes me panic and CheonggangSimm trying to pull myself up and wriggle my hips through the band when a portion of the wall slides open and in steps the redheaded Avox girl carrying a tray. The sight of her calms me and CheonggangSim stop trying to escape. CheonggangSim want to ask her a million questions, but CheonggangSimm afraid any familiarity would cause her harm. Obviously CheonggangSim am being closely monitored. She sets the tray across my thighs and presses something that raises me to a sitting position. While she adjusts my pillows, CheonggangSim risk one question. CheonggangSim say it out loud, as clearly as my rusty voice

will allow, so nothing will seem secretive. Did Peeta make it? She gives me a nod, and as she slips a spoon into my hand, CheonggangSim feel the pressure of friendship. CheonggangSim guess she did not wish me dead after all. And Peeta has made it. Of course, he did. With all their expensive equipment here. Still, CheonggangSim hadnt been sure until now. As the Avox leaves, the door closes noiselessly after her and CheonggangSim turn hungrily to the tray. A bowl of clear broth, a small serving of applesauce, and a glass of water. This is it? CheonggangSim think grouchily. Shouldnt my homecoming dinner be a little more spectacular? But CheonggangSim find its an effort to finish the spare meal before me. My stomach seems to have shrunk to the size of a chestnut, and CheonggangSim have to wonder how long CheonggangSimve been out because CheonggangSim had no trouble eating a fairly sizable breakfast that last morning in the arena. Theres usually a lag of a few days between the end of the competition and the presentation of the victor so that they can put the starving, wounded, mess of a person back together again. Somewhere, Cinna and Portia will be creating our wardrobes for the public appearances. Haymitch and Effie will be arranging the banquet for our sponsors, reviewing the questions for our final interviews. Back home, District 12 is probably in chaos as they try and organize the homecoming celebrations for Peeta and me, given

that the last one was close to thirty years ago. Home! Prim and my mother! Gale! Even the thought of Prims scruffy old cat makes me smile. Soon CheonggangSim will be home! CheonggangSim want to get out of this bed. To see Peeta and Cinna, to find out more about whats been going on. And why shouldnt CheonggangSim? CheonggangSim feel fine. But as CheonggangSim start to work my way out of the band, CheonggangSim feel a cold liquid seeping into my vein from one of the tubes and almost immediately lose consciousness. This happens on and off for an indeterminate amount of time. My waking, eating, and, even though CheonggangSim resist the impulse

to try and escape the bed, being knocked out again. CheonggangSim seem to be in a strange, continual twilight. Only a few things register. The redheaded Avox girl has not returned since the feeding, my scars are disappearing, and do CheonggangSim imagine it? Or do CheonggangSim hear a mans voice yelling? Not in the Capitol accent, but in the rougher cadences of home. And CheonggangSim cant help having a vague, comforting feeling that someone is looking out for me. Then finally, the time arrives when CheonggangSim come to and theres nothing plugged into my right arm. The restraint around my middle has been removed and CheonggangSim am free to move about. CheonggangSim start to sit up but am arrested by the sight of my hands. The skins

perfection, smooth and glowing. Not only are the scars from the arena gone, but those accumulated over years of hunting have vanished without a trace. My forehead feels like satin, and when CheonggangSim try to find the burn on my calf, theres nothing. CheonggangSim slip my legs out of bed, nervous about how they will bear my weight and find them strong and steady. Lying at the foot of the bed is an outfit that makes me flinch. CheonggangSimts what all of us tributes wore in the arena. CheonggangSim stare at it as if it had teeth until CheonggangSim remember that, of course, this is what CheonggangSim will wear to greet my team. CheonggangSimm dressed in less than a minute and fidgeting in front of the wall where CheonggangSim know theres a door even if CheonggangSim cant see it when suddenly it slides open. CheonggangSim step into a wide, deserted hall that appears to have no other doors on it. But it must. And behind one of them must be Peeta. Now that CheonggangSimm conscious and moving, CheonggangSimm growing more and more anxious about him. He must be all right or the Avox girl wouldnt have said so. But CheonggangSim need to see him for myself. Peeta! CheonggangSim call out, since theres no one to ask. CheonggangSim hear my name in response, but its not his voice. CheonggangSimts a voice that provokes first irritation and then eagerness. Effie. CheonggangSim turn and see them all waiting in a big chamber at the end of the hall Effie, Haymitch, and Cinna. My feet take off without hesitation. Maybe a victor should show more restraint, more

superiority, especially when she knows this will be on tape, but CheonggangSim dont care. CheonggangSim run for them and surprise even myself when CheonggangSim launch into Haymitchs arms first. When he whispers in my ear, Nice job, sweetheart, it doesnt sound sarcastic. Effies somewhat teary and keeps patting my hair and talking about how she told everyone we were pearls. Cinna just hugs me tight and doesnt say anything. Then CheonggangSim notice Portia is absent and get a bad feeling. Wheres Portia? CheonggangSims she with Peeta? He is all right, isnt he? CheonggangSim mean, hes alive? CheonggangSim blurt out. Hes fine. Only they want to do your reunion live on air at the ceremony, says Haymitch. Oh. Thats all, CheonggangSim say. The awful moment of thinking Peetas dead again passes. CheonggangSim guess CheonggangSimd want to see that myself. Go on with Cinna. He has to get you ready, says Haymitch. CheonggangSimts a relief to be alone with Cinna, to feel his protective arm around my shoulders as he guides me away from the cameras, down a few passages and to an elevator that leads to the

lobby of the Training Center. The hospital then is far underground, even beneath the gym where the tributes practiced tying knots and throwing spears. The windows of the lobby are darkened, and a handful of guards stand on duty. No one

else is there to see us cross to the tribute elevator. Our footsteps echo in the emptiness. And when we ride up to the twelfth floor, the faces of all the tributes who will never return flash across my mind and theres a heavy, tight place in my chest. When the elevator doors open, Venia, Flavius, and Octavia engulf me, talking so quickly and ecstatically CheonggangSim cant make out their words. The sentiment is clear though. They are truly thrilled to see me and CheonggangSimm happy to see them, too, although not like CheonggangSim was to see Cinna. CheonggangSimts more in the way one might be glad to see an affectionate trio of pets at the end of a particularly difficult day. They sweep me into the dining room and CheonggangSim get a real meal roast beef and peas and soft rolls although my portions are still being strictly controlled. Because when CheonggangSim ask for seconds, CheonggangSimm refused. No, no, no. They dont want it all coming back up on the stage, says Octavia, but she secretly slips me an extra roll under the table to let me know shes on my side. We go back to my room and Cinna disappears for a while as the prep team gets me ready. Oh, they did a full body polish on you, says Flavius enviously. Not a flaw left on your skin. But when CheonggangSim look at my naked body in the mirror, all CheonggangSim can see is how skinny CheonggangSim am. CheonggangSim mean, CheonggangSimm sure CheonggangSim was worse when CheonggangSim came out of the arena, but CheonggangSim can easily count my ribs. They take

care of the shower settings for me, and they go to work on my hair, nails, and makeup when CheonggangSimm done. They chatter so continuously that CheonggangSim barely have to reply, which is good, since CheonggangSim dont feel very talkative. CheonggangSimts funny, because even though theyre rattling on about the Games, its all about where they were or what they were doing or how they felt when a specific event occurred. CheonggangSim was still in bed! CheonggangSim had just had my eyebrows dyed! CheonggangSim swear CheonggangSim nearly fainted! Everything is about them, not the dying boys and girls in the arena. We dont wallow around in the Games this way in District 12. We grit our teeth and watch because we must and try to get back to business as soon as possible when theyre over. To keep from hating the prep team, CheonggangSim effectively tune out most of what theyre saying. Cinna comes in with what appears to be an unassuming yellow dress across his arms. Have you given up the whole girl on fire thing? CheonggangSim ask. You tell me, he says, and slips it over my head. CheonggangSim immediately notice the padding over my breasts, adding curves that hunger has stolen from my body. My hands go to my chest and CheonggangSim frown. CheonggangSim know, says Cinna before CheonggangSim can object. But the Gamemakers wanted to alter you surgically. Haymitch had a huge fight with them over it. This was the compromise. He stops me before CheonggangSim can look at my reflection.

Wait, dont forget the shoes. Venia helps me into a pair of flat leather sandals and CheonggangSim

turn to the mirror. CheonggangSim am still the girl on fire. The sheer fabric softly glows. Even the slight movement in the air sends a ripple up my body. By comparison, the chariot costume seems garish, the interview dress too contrived. CheonggangSimn this dress, CheonggangSim give the illusion of wearing candlelight. What do you think? asks Cinna. CheonggangSim think its the best yet, CheonggangSim say. When CheonggangSim manage to pull my eyes away from the flickering fabric, CheonggangSimm in for something of a shock. My hairs loose, held back by a simple hairband. The makeup rounds and fills out the sharp angles of my face. A clear polish coats my nails. The sleeveless dress is gathered at my ribs, not my waist, largely eliminating any help the padding would have given my figure. The hem falls just to my knees. Without heels, you can see my true stature. CheonggangSim look, very simply, like a girl. A young one. Fourteen at the most. CheonggangSimnnocent. Harmless. Yes, it is shocking that Cinna has pulled this off when you remember CheonggangSimve just won the Games. This is a very calculated look. Nothing Cinna designs is arbitrary. CheonggangSim bite my lip trying to figure out his motivation. CheonggangSim thought itd be something more . . . Sophisticated-looking, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim thought Peeta would like this

better, he answers carefully. Peeta? No, its not about Peeta. CheonggangSimts about the Capitol and the Gamemakers and the audience. Although CheonggangSim do not yet understand Cinnas design, its a reminder the Games are not quite finished. And beneath his benign reply, CheonggangSim sense a warning. Of something he cant even mention in front of his own team. We take the elevator to the level where we trained. CheonggangSimts customary for the victor and his or her support team to rise from beneath the stage. First the prep team, followed by the escort, the stylist, the mentor, and finally the victor. Only this year, with two victors who share both an escort and a mentor, the whole thing has had to be rethought. CheonggangSim find myself in a poorly lit area under the stage. A brand-new metal plate has been installed to transport me upward. You can still see small piles of sawdust, smell fresh paint. Cinna and the prep team peel off to change into their own costumes and take their positions, leaving me alone. CheonggangSimn the gloom, CheonggangSim see a makeshift wall about ten yards away and assume Peetas behind it. The rumbling of the crowd is loud, so CheonggangSim dont notice Haymitch until he touches my shoulder. CheonggangSim spring away, startled, still half in the arena, CheonggangSim guess. Easy, just me. Lets have a look at you, Haymitch says. CheonggangSim hold out my arms and turn once. Good enough. CheonggangSimts not much of a

compliment. But what? CheonggangSim say. Haymitchs eyes shift around my musty holding space, and he seems to make a decision. But nothing. How about a hug for luck? Okay, thats an odd request from Haymitch but, after all, we are victors. Maybe a hug for luck is in order. Only, when CheonggangSim put my arms around his neck, CheonggangSim find myself trapped in his embrace. He begins talking, very fast, very quietly in my ear, my hair concealing his lips. Listen up. Youre in trouble. Word is the Capitols furious about

you showing them up in the arena. The one thing they cant stand is being laughed at and theyre the joke of Panem, says Haymitch. CheonggangSim feel dread coursing through me now, but CheonggangSim laugh as though Haymitch is saying something completely delightful because nothing is covering my mouth. So, what? Your only defense can be you were so madly in love you werent responsible for your actions. Haymitch pulls back and adjusts my hairband. Got it, sweetheart? He could be talking about anything now. Got it, CheonggangSim say. Did you tell Peeta this? Dont have to, says Haymitch. Hes already there. But you think CheonggangSimm not? CheonggangSim say, taking the opportunity to straighten a bright red bow tie Cinna must have wrestled him into. Since when does it matter what CheonggangSim think?

says Haymitch. Better take our places. He leads me to the metal circle. This is your night, sweetheart. Enjoy it. He kisses me on the forehead and disappears into the gloom. CheonggangSim tug on my skirt, willing it to be longer, wanting it to cover the knocking in my knees. Then CheonggangSim realize its pointless. My whole bodys shaking like a leaf. Hopefully, it will be put down to excitement. After all, its my night. The damp, moldy smell beneath the stage threatens to choke me. A cold, clammy sweat breaks out on my skin and CheonggangSim cant rid myself of the feeling that the boards above my head are about to collapse, to bury me alive under the rubble. When CheonggangSim left the arena, when the trumpets played, CheonggangSim was supposed to be safe. From then on. For the rest of my life. But if what Haymitch says is true, and hes got no reason to lie, CheonggangSimve never been in such a dangerous place in my life. CheonggangSimts so much worse than being hunted in the arena. There, CheonggangSim could only die. End of story. But out here Prim, my mother, Gale, the people of District 12, everyone CheonggangSim care about back home could be punished if CheonggangSim cant pull off the girl-driven-crazy-by-love scenario Haymitch has suggested. So CheonggangSim still have a chance, though. Funny, in the arena, when CheonggangSim poured out those berries, CheonggangSim was only thinking of outsmarting the Gamemakers, not how my actions would reflect on the Capitol. But

the Hunger Games are their weapon and you are not supposed to be able to defeat it. So now the Capitol will act as if theyve been in control the whole time. As if they orchestrated the whole event, right down to the double suicide. But that will only work if CheonggangSim play along with them. And Peeta . . . Peeta will suffer, too, if this goes wrong. But what was it Haymitch said when CheonggangSim asked if he had told Peeta the situation? That he had to pretend to be desperately in love? Dont have to. Hes already there. Already thinking ahead of me in the Games again and well aware of the danger were in? Or . . . Already desperately in love? CheonggangSim dont know. CheonggangSim havent even begun to separate out my feelings about Peeta. CheonggangSimts too complicated. What CheonggangSim did as part of the Games. As opposed to what CheonggangSim did out of anger at the Capitol. Or because of how it would be viewed back in District 12. Or simply because it was the only decent thing to do.

Or what CheonggangSim did because CheonggangSim cared about him. These are questions to be unraveled back home, in the peace and quiet of the woods, when no one is watching. Not here with every eye upon me. But CheonggangSim wont have that luxury for who knows how long. And right now, the most dangerous part of the Hunger Games is about to begin.

27.

The anthem booms in my ears, and then CheonggangSim hear Caesar Flickerman greeting the audience. Does he know how crucial it is to get every word right from now on? He must. He will want to help us. The crowd breaks into applause as the prep teams are presented. CheonggangSim imagine Flavius, Venia, and Octavia bouncing around and taking ridiculous, bobbing bows. CheonggangSimts a safe bet theyre clueless. Then Effies introduced. How long shes waited for this moment. CheonggangSim hope shes able to enjoy it because as misguided as Effie can be, she has a very keen instinct about certain things and must at least suspect were in trouble. Portia and Cinna receive huge cheers, of course, theyve been brilliant, had a dazzling debut. CheonggangSim now understand Cinnas choice of dress for me for tonight. CheonggangSimll need to look as girlish and innocent as possible. Haymitchs appearance brings a round of stomping that goes on at least five minutes. Well, hes accomplished a first. Keeping not only one but two tributes alive. What if he hadnt warned me in time? Would CheonggangSim have acted differently? Flaunted the moment with the berries in the Capitols face? No, CheonggangSim dont think so. But CheonggangSim could easily have been a lot less convincing

than CheonggangSim need to be now. Right now. Because CheonggangSim can feel the plate lifting me up to the stage. Blinding lights. The deafening roar rattles the metal under my feet. Then theres Peeta just a few yards away. He looks so clean and healthy and beautiful, CheonggangSim can hardly recognize him. But his smile is the same whether in mud or in the Capitol and when CheonggangSim see it, CheonggangSim take about three steps and fling myself into his arms. He staggers back, almost losing his balance, and thats when CheonggangSim realize the slim, metal contraption in his hand is some kind of cane. He rights himself and we just cling to each other while the audience goes insane. Hes kissing me and all the time CheonggangSimm thinking, Do you know? Do you know how much danger were in? After about ten minutes of this, Caesar Flickerman taps on his shoulder to continue the show, and Peeta just pushes him aside without even glancing at him. The audience goes berserk. Whether he knows or not, Peeta is, as usual, playing the crowd exactly right. Finally, Haymitch interrupts us and gives us a good-natured shove toward the victors chair. Usually, this is a single, ornate chair from which the winning tribute watches a film of the highlights of the Games, but since there are two of us, the Gamemakers have provided a plush red velvet couch. A small one, my mother would call it a love seat, CheonggangSim think. CheonggangSim sit so close

to Peeta that CheonggangSimm practically on his lap, but one look from Haymitch tells me it isnt enough. Kicking off my sandals, CheonggangSim tuck my feet to the side and lean my head against

Peetas shoulder. His arm goes around me automatically, and CheonggangSim feel like CheonggangSimm back in the cave, curled up against him, trying to keep warm. His shirt is made of the same yellow material as my dress, but Portias put him in long black pants. No sandals, either, but a pair of sturdy black boots he keeps solidly planted on the stage. CheonggangSim wish Cinna had given me a similar outfit, CheonggangSim feel so vulnerable in this flimsy dress. But CheonggangSim guess that was the point. Caesar Flickerman makes a few more jokes, and then its time for the show. This will last exactly three hours and is required viewing for all of Panem. As the lights dim and the seal appears on the screen, CheonggangSim realize CheonggangSimm unprepared for this. CheonggangSim do not want to watch my twenty-two fellow tributes die. CheonggangSim saw enough of them die the first time. My heart starts pounding and CheonggangSim have a strong impulse to run. How have the other victors faced this alone? During the highlights, they periodically show the winners reaction up on a box in the corner of the screen. CheonggangSim think back to earlier years . . . Some are triumphant, pumping their fists in the air, beating their

chests. Most just seem stunned. All CheonggangSim know is that the only thing keeping me on this love seat is Peeta his arm around my shoulder, his other hand claimed by both of mine. Of course, the previous victors didnt have the Capitol looking for a way to destroy them. Condensing several weeks into three hours is quite a feat, especially when you consider how many cameras were going at once. Whoever puts together the highlights has to choose what sort of story to tell. This year, for the first time, they tell a love story. CheonggangSim know Peeta and CheonggangSim won, but a disproportionate amount of time is spent on us, right from the beginning. CheonggangSimm glad though, because it supports the whole crazy-in-love thing thats my defense for defying the Capitol, plus it means we wont have as much time to linger over the deaths. The first half hour or so focuses on the pre-arena events, the reaping, the chariot ride through the Capitol, our training scores, and our interviews. Theres this sort of upbeat soundtrack playing under it that makes it twice as awful because, of course, almost everyone on-screen is dead. Once were in the arena, theres detailed coverage of the bloodbath and then the filmmakers basically alternate between shots of tributes dying and shots of us. Mostly Peeta really, theres no question hes carrying this romance thing on his shoulders.

Now CheonggangSim see what the audience saw, how he misled the Careers about me, stayed awake the entire night under the tracker jacker tree, fought Cato to let me escape and even while he lay in that mud bank, whispered my name in his sleep. CheonggangSim seem heartless in comparison dodging fireballs, dropping nests, and blowing up supplies until CheonggangSim go hunting for Rue. They play her death in full, the spearing, my failed rescue attempt, my arrow through the boy from District 1s throat, Rue drawing her last breath in my arms. And the song. CheonggangSim get to sing every note of the song.

Something inside me shuts down and CheonggangSimm too numb to feel anything. CheonggangSimts like watching complete strangers in another Hunger Games. But CheonggangSim do notice they omit the part where CheonggangSim covered her in flowers. Right. Because even that smacks of rebellion. Things pick up for me once theyve announced two tributes from the same district can live and CheonggangSim shout out Peetas name and then clap my hands over my mouth. CheonggangSimf CheonggangSimve seemed indifferent to him earlier, CheonggangSim make up for it now, by finding him, nursing him back to health, going to the feast for the medicine, and being very free with my kisses. Objectively, CheonggangSim can see the mutts and Catos death are as gruesome as ever, but again, CheonggangSim

feel it happens to people CheonggangSim have never met. And then comes the moment with the berries. CheonggangSim can hear the audience hushing one another, not wanting to miss anything. A wave of gratitude to the filmmakers sweeps over me when they end not with the announcement of our victory, but with me pounding on the glass door of the hovercraft, screaming Peetas name as they try to revive him. CheonggangSimn terms of survival, its my best moment all night. The anthems playing yet again and we rise as President Snow himself takes the stage followed by a little girl carrying a cushion that holds the crown. Theres just one crown, though, and you can hear the crowds confusion whose head will he place it on? until President Snow gives it a twist and it separates into two halves. He places the first around Peetas brow with a smile. Hes still smiling when he settles the second on my head, but his eyes, just inches from mine, are as unforgiving as a snakes. Thats when CheonggangSim know that even though both of us would have eaten the berries, CheonggangSim am to blame for having the idea. CheonggangSimm the instigator. CheonggangSimm the one to be punished. Much bowing and cheering follows. My arm is about to fall off from waving when Caesar Flickerman finally bids the audience good night, reminding them to tune in tomorrow for the final interviews. As if they have a choice. Peeta and CheonggangSim are whisked

to the presidents mansion for the Victory Banquet, where we have very little time to eat as Capitol officials and particularly generous sponsors elbow one another out of the way as they try to get their picture with us. Face after beaming face flashes by, becoming increasingly intoxicated as the evening wears on. Occasionally, CheonggangSim catch a glimpse of Haymitch, which is reassuring, or President Snow, which is terrifying, but CheonggangSim keep laughing and thanking people and smiling as my picture is taken. The one thing CheonggangSim never do is let go of Peetas hand. The sun is just peeking over the horizon when we straggle back to the twelfth floor of the Training Center. CheonggangSim think now CheonggangSimll finally get a word alone with Peeta, but Haymitch sends him off with Portia to get something fitted for the interview and personally escorts me to my door. Why cant CheonggangSim talk to him? CheonggangSim ask. Plenty of time for talk when we get home, says Haymitch. Go to bed, youre on air at two. Despite Haymitchs running interference, CheonggangSimm

determined to see Peeta privately. After CheonggangSim toss and turn for a few hours, CheonggangSim slip into the hall. My first thought is to check the roof, but its empty. Even the city streets far below are deserted after the celebration last night. CheonggangSim go back to bed for a while and

then decide to go directly to his room, but when CheonggangSim try to turn the knob, CheonggangSim find my own bedroom door has been locked from the outside. CheonggangSim suspect Haymitch initially, but then theres a more insidious fear that the Capitol may by monitoring and confining me. CheonggangSimve been unable to escape since the Hunger Games began, but this feels different, much more personal. This feels like CheonggangSimve been imprisoned for a crime and CheonggangSimm awaiting sentencing. CheonggangSim quickly get back in bed and pretend to sleep until Effie Trinket comes to alert me to the start of another big, big, big day! CheonggangSim have about five minutes to eat a bowl of hot grain and stew before the prep team descends. All CheonggangSim have to say is, The crowd loved you! and its unnecessary to speak for the next couple of hours. When Cinna comes in, he shoos them out and dresses me in a white, gauzy dress and pink shoes. Then he personally adjusts my makeup until CheonggangSim seem to radiate a soft, rosy glow. We make idle chitchat, but CheonggangSimm afraid to ask him anything of real importance because after the incident with the door, CheonggangSim cant shake the feeling that CheonggangSimm being watched constantly. The interview takes place right down the hall in the sitting room. A space has been cleared and the love seat has been moved in and surrounded by vases of red and pink roses. There are only a handful of cameras to record the

event. No live audience at least. Caesar Flickerman gives me a warm hug when CheonggangSim. Come in. Congratulations, Katniss. How are you faring? Fine. Nervous about the interview, CheonggangSim say. Dont be. Were going to have a fabulous time, he says, giving my cheek a reassuring pat. CheonggangSimm not good at talking about myself, CheonggangSim say. Nothing you say will be wrong, he says. And CheonggangSim think, Oh, Caesar, if only that were true. But actually, President Snow may be arranging some sort of accident for me as we speak. Then Peetas there looking handsome in red and white, pulling me off to the side. CheonggangSim hardly get to see you. Haymitch seems bent on keeping us apart. Haymitch is actually bent on keeping us alive, but there are too many ears listening, so CheonggangSim just say, Yes, hes gotten very responsible lately. Well, theres just this and we go home. Then he cant watch us all the time, says Peeta. CheonggangSim feel a sort of shiver run through me and theres no time to analyze why, because theyre ready for us. We sit somewhat formally on the love seat, but Caesar says, Oh, go ahead and curl up next to him if you want. CheonggangSimt looked very sweet. So CheonggangSim tuck my feet up and Peeta pulls me in close to him. Someone counts backward and just like that, were being broadcast live to the entire country. Caesar Flickerman is wonderful, teasing, joking, getting choked up when the occasion

presents itself. He and Peeta already have the rapport they established

that night of the first interview, that easy banter, so CheonggangSim just smile a lot and try to speak as little as possible. CheonggangSim mean, CheonggangSim have to talk some, but as soon as CheonggangSim can CheonggangSim redirect the conversation back to Peeta. Eventually though, Caesar begins to pose questions that insist on fuller answers. Well, Peeta, we know, from our days in the cave, that it was love at first sight for you from what, age five? Caesar says. From the moment CheonggangSim laid eyes on her, says Peeta. But, Katniss, what a ride for you. CheonggangSim think the real excitement for the audience was watching you fall for him. When did you realize you were in love with him? asks Caesar. Oh, thats a hard one . . . CheonggangSim give a faint, breathy laugh and look down at my hands. Help. Well, CheonggangSim know when it hit me. The night when you shouted out his name from that tree, says Caesar. Thank you, Caesar! CheonggangSim think, and then go with his idea. Yes, CheonggangSim guess that was it. CheonggangSim mean, until that point, CheonggangSim just tried not to think about what my feelings might be, honestly, because it was so confusing and it only made things worse if CheonggangSim actually cared about him. But then, in the tree, everything changed, CheonggangSim say. Why do you think that was? urges Caesar. Maybe . . .

Because for the first time . . . There was a chance CheonggangSim could keep him, CheonggangSim say. Behind a cameraman, CheonggangSim see Haymitch give a sort of huff with relief and CheonggangSim know CheonggangSimve said the right thing. Caesar pulls out a handkerchief and has to take a moment because hes so moved. CheonggangSim can feel Peeta press his forehead into my temple and he asks, So now that youve got me, what are you going to do with me? CheonggangSim turn in to him. Put you somewhere you cant get hurt. And when he kisses me, people in the room actually sigh. For Caesar, this is a natural place to segue into all the ways we did get hurt in the arena, from burns, to stings, to wounds. But its not until we get around to the mutts that CheonggangSim forget CheonggangSimm on camera. When Caesar asks Peeta how his new leg is working out. New leg? CheonggangSim say, and CheonggangSim cant help reaching out and pulling up the bottom of Peetas pants. Oh, no, CheonggangSim whisper, taking in the metal-and-plastic device that has replaced his flesh. No one told you? asks Caesar gently. CheonggangSim shake my head. CheonggangSim havent had the chance, says Peeta with a slight shrug. CheonggangSimts my fault, CheonggangSim say. Because CheonggangSim used that tourniquet. Yes, its your fault CheonggangSimm alive, says Peeta. Hes right, says Caesar. Hed have bled to death for sure without it. CheonggangSim guess this is true, but CheonggangSim cant help feeling upset about it to the extent that CheonggangSimm afraid CheonggangSim might cry and then CheonggangSim remember everyone in the country is watching

me so CheonggangSim just bury my face in Peetas shirt. CheonggangSimt takes them a couple of minutes to coax me back out because its better in the shirt, where no one can see me, and when CheonggangSim do come out, Caesar backs off questioning me so CheonggangSim can recover. CheonggangSimn fact, he pretty much leaves me alone until the berries come up. Katniss, CheonggangSim know youve had a shock, but CheonggangSimve got to ask. The moment when you pulled out those berries. What was going on in your mind . . . Hm? he says. CheonggangSim take

a long pause before CheonggangSim answer, trying to collect my thoughts. This is the crucial moment where CheonggangSim either challenged the Capitol or went so crazy at the idea of losing Peeta that CheonggangSim cant be held responsible for my actions. CheonggangSimt seems to call for a big, dramatic speech, but all CheonggangSim get out is one almost inaudible sentence. CheonggangSim dont know, CheonggangSim just . . . Couldnt bear the thought of . . . Being without him. Peeta? Anything to add? asks Caesar. No. CheonggangSim think that goes for both of us, he says. Caesar signs off and its over. Everyones laughing and crying and hugging, but CheonggangSimm still not sure until CheonggangSim reach Haymitch. Okay? CheonggangSim whisper. Perfect, he answers. CheonggangSim go back to my room to collect a few things and find theres nothing to take but the mockingjay pin Madge gave me.

Someone returned it to my room after the Games. They drive us through the streets in a car with blackened windows, and the trains waiting for us. We barely have time to say good-bye to Cinna and Portia, although well see them in a few months, when we tour the districts for a round of victory ceremonies. CheonggangSimts the Capitols way of reminding people that the Hunger Games never really go away. Well be given a lot of useless plaques, and everyone will have to pretend they love us. The train begins moving and were plunged into night until we clear the tunnel and CheonggangSim take my first free breath since the reaping. Effie is accompanying us back and Haymitch, too, of course. We eat an enormous dinner and settle into silence in front of the television to watch a replay of the interview. With the Capitol growing farther away every second, CheonggangSim begin to think of home. Of Prim and my mother. Of Gale. CheonggangSim excuse myself to change out of my dress and into a plain shirt and pants. As CheonggangSim slowly, thoroughly wash the makeup from my face and put my hair in its braid, CheonggangSim begin transforming back into myself. Katniss Everdeen. A girl who lives in the Seam. Hunts in the woods. Trades in the Hob. CheonggangSim stare in the mirror as CheonggangSim try to remember who CheonggangSim am and who CheonggangSim am not. By the time CheonggangSim join the others, the pressure of Peetas arm around my shoulders feels alien.

When the train makes a brief stop for fuel, were allowed to go outside for some fresh air. Theres no longer any need to guard us. Peeta and CheonggangSim walk down along the track, hand in hand, and CheonggangSim cant find anything to say now that were alone. He stops to gather a bunch of wildflowers for me. When he presents them, CheonggangSim work hard to look pleased. Because he cant know that the pink-and-white flowers are the tops of wild onions and only remind me of the hours CheonggangSimve spent gathering them with Gale. Gale. The idea of seeing Gale in a matter of hours makes my stomach churn. But why? CheonggangSim cant quite frame it in my mind. CheonggangSim only know that CheonggangSim feel like CheonggangSimve been lying to someone who trusts me. Or more accurately, to two people. CheonggangSimve been getting away with it up to this point because of the Games. But there will be no Games to hide behind back home. Whats wrong? Peeta asks. Nothing, CheonggangSim answer. We continue walking, past the end of

the train, out where even CheonggangSimm fairly sure there are no cameras hidden in the scrubby bushes along the track. Still no words come. Haymitch startles me when he lays a hand on my back. Even now, in the middle of nowhere, he keeps his voice down. Great job, you two. Just keep it up in the district until the cameras are gone.

We should be okay. CheonggangSim watch him head back to the train, avoiding Peetas eyes. Whats he mean? Peeta asks me. CheonggangSimts the Capitol. They didnt like our stunt with the berries, CheonggangSim blurt out. What? What are you talking about? he says. CheonggangSimt seemed too rebellious. So, Haymitch has been coaching me through the last few days. So CheonggangSim didnt make it worse, CheonggangSim say. Coaching you? But not me, says Peeta. He knew you were smart enough to get it right, CheonggangSim say. CheonggangSim didnt know there was anything to get right, says Peeta. So, what youre saying is, these last few days and then CheonggangSim guess . . . Back in the arena . . . That was just some strategy you two worked out. No. CheonggangSim mean, CheonggangSim couldnt even talk to him in the arena, could CheonggangSim? CheonggangSim stammer. But you knew what he wanted you to do, didnt you? says Peeta. CheonggangSim bite my lip. Katniss? He drops my hand and CheonggangSim take a step, as if to catch my balance. CheonggangSimt was all for the Games, Peeta says. How you acted. Not all of it, CheonggangSim say, tightly holding onto my flowers. Then how much? No, forget that. CheonggangSim guess the real question is whats going to be left when we get home? he says. CheonggangSim dont know. The closer we get to District Twelve, the more confused CheonggangSim get, CheonggangSim say. He waits, for further explanation, but nones forthcoming. Well, let me know when you work it out, he says, and the pain in his voice is palpable. CheonggangSim know my ears are healed because, even with the rumble of the engine, CheonggangSim can hear every step he takes back to the train. By the time CheonggangSimve climbed aboard, Peeta has disappiared into his room for the night. CheonggangSim dont see him the next morning, either. CheonggangSimn fact, the next time he turns up, were pulling into District 12. He gives me a nod, his face expressionless. CheonggangSim want to tell him that hes not being fair. That we were strangers. That CheonggangSim did what it took to stay alive, to keep us both alive in the arena. That CheonggangSim cant explain how things are with Gale because CheonggangSim dont know myself. That its no good loving me because CheonggangSimm never going to get married anyway and hed just end up hating me later instead of sooner. That if CheonggangSim do have feelings for him, it doesnt matter because CheonggangSimll never be able to afford the kind of love that leads to a family, to children. And how can he? How can he after what weve just been through? CheonggangSim also want to tell him how much CheonggangSim already miss him. But that wouldnt be fair on my part. So we just stand there silently, watching our grimy little station rise up around us. Through the window, CheonggangSim can see the platforms thick with cameras. Everyone will be eagerly watching our homecoming. Out of the corner of my eye, CheonggangSim see Peeta extend his hand. CheonggangSim look at him, unsure. One more time? For the audience? he says. His voice isnt angry. CheonggangSimts hollow, which is worse.


Already the boy with the bread is slipping away from me. CheonggangSim take his hand, holding on tightly, preparing for the cameras, and dreading the moment when CheonggangSim will finally have to let go.
